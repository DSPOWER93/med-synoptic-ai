Patient Information:
	•Name: Ann Legault
	•Date of Birth: 01/01/1970
	•Medical Record Number: M1144
	•Date of Admission: 03/02/2022
	•Date of Discharge: 05/10/2022
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Jaclyn Babcock
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer (Stage IIIB)

Reason for Admission:
	Mr. Legault presented to the emergency department with complaints of persistent abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, and unexplained weight loss over a period of six months. The initial assessment revealed an acute abdomen, and diagnostic investigations including computed tomography (CT) scan, colonoscopy, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) blood test confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the descending colon.

Medical History:
	Mr. Legault has a significant medical history, with chronic conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He had undergone a total knee replacement surgery in 2015. His family history is notable for colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. He is allergic to penicillin and has a known sensitivity to contrast agents. Prior to admission, he was taking metformin, lisinopril, albuterol, ipratropium, and aspirin.

Diagnostic Findings:
	The CT scan revealed a large mass in the descending colon with regional lymph node involvement. Pathology reports confirmed the diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. CEA levels were significantly elevated at 12.5 ng/mL (normal range <5 ng/mL).

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Legault. This included a right hemicolectomy with anastomosis, followed by six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil (FOLFIRI). Radiation therapy was not deemed necessary due to the extent of surgical resection.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Legault underwent a successful hemicolectomy on March 5th. His post-operative course was complicated by anastomotic leak, which required a second surgery and a temporary ostomy (ileal conduit). He received intensive nutritional support during his hospital stay to aid in recovery. The patient's condition stabilized, and he demonstrated significant improvement over the subsequent weeks.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Mr. Legault will be scheduled for regular outpatient appointments every three months for the first year post-discharge, then every six months thereafter. He will continue his current medications, with adjustments as necessary based on blood glucose and blood pressure readings. A low-fiber diet is recommended to minimize discomfort related to the ileal conduit. If Mr. Legault experiences signs of complications such as increased abdominal pain, fever, or changes in bowel habits, he should seek immediate medical attention.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Legault and his family were provided extensive education on post-surgical care, management of the ileal conduit, signs of complications, and common side effects of chemotherapy (such as nausea, fatigue, and neutropenia).

Discharge Instructions:
	Mr. Legault was provided with comprehensive discharge instructions to ensure his continued recovery and health maintenance. These included medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration guidelines, and physical activity recommendations.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial in patients with colorectal cancer. Mr. Legault was informed of the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet.

Final Remarks:
	Dr. Babcock commends Mr. Legault on his resilience and cooperation throughout his treatment journey. She encourages him to continue this positive attitude as he transitions to outpatient care. Both the physician and patient have signed this report, validating its authenticity.
