Patient Information:
	•Name: Jacqueline Collins
	•Date of Birth: 03/24/1965
	•Medical Record Number: M1196
	•Date of Admission: 01/02/2023
	•Date of Discharge: 01/31/2023
	•Attending Physician: Dr. James Collins
	•Primary Diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma of the Colon (Stage III)

Reason for Admission:
	Jacqueline Collins was admitted to our facility on 01/02/2023 due to the acute onset of abdominal pain, distension, and change in bowel habits. He reported a sudden increase in abdominal discomfort accompanied by a decrease in appetite and weight loss over the past two months. The initial assessment revealed tenderness in the lower quadrant of his abdomen, palpable mass, and positive Rovsing's sign. Subsequent diagnostic investigations including CT scans, colonoscopy, and pathology confirmed the diagnosis of Adenocarcinoma of the Colon (Jacqueline Collins).

Medical History:
	Mr. Collins has a significant medical history marked by hypertension, diabetes, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). He has undergone multiple surgeries in the past, including a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2015 and a left nephrectomy in 2018. His family history is notable for colon cancer, with his father diagnosed at age 65. He has known allergies to penicillin and sulfa drugs, and was taking metformin, lisinopril, and albuterol before admission.

Diagnostic Findings:
	The diagnostic tests conducted during the hospital stay revealed a large mass in the transverse colon with regional lymph node involvement. Pathology reports confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Blood tests showed elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicative of malignancy. Imaging scans revealed no evidence of distant metastasis.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Collins, including surgical intervention, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. He underwent a laparoscopic left hemicolectomy on 01/06/2023, followed by an ileal conduit formation. Post-operative care involved pain management, antibiotics to prevent infection, and bowel rest for the initial recovery phase. A six-month regimen of FOLFOX (Folinic acid, Fluorouracil, and Oxaliplatin) chemotherapy was initiated. Given the extent of the disease, radiation therapy was also considered as an adjuvant treatment option.

Hospital Course:
	

Follow-Up Plan:
	Mr. Collins will be scheduled for regular follow-up appointments every three months for the first year, then six-monthly thereafter. His medications will include leucovorin, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to protect his stomach from the side effects of chemotherapy. A low-fiber, high-protein diet is recommended, along with adequate hydration. He should avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity for six weeks post-surgery. In case of any severe abdominal pain, fever, or rectal bleeding, immediate medical attention is advised.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Collins and his family were educated about the nature of the disease, the role of chemotherapy, and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan. They were instructed on post-surgical care, including ileal conduit management, recognizing signs of complications such as leakage or obstruction, and managing common side effects like nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue.

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Collins was provided with clear instructions on medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration, and physical activity guidelines. He was also given a detailed written summary of the treatment plan and follow-up schedule.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial. Mr. Collins will need to manage ongoing health issues such as hypertension, diabetes, and COPD in addition to his cancer treatment.

Final Remarks:
	This report concludes the treatment journey of Jacqueline Collins, who demonstrated remarkable resilience and cooperation throughout his treatment. We are hopeful for a positive outcome, and we encourage Mr. Collins to continue following the prescribed treatment plan. Sincerely, Dr. James Collins, M.D. (Signature)
