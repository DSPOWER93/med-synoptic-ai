Reason for Admission:
	Mr. Terry Baker, aged 52, presented to the emergency department complaining of a persistent abdominal pain that had escalated over the past week, associated with unexplained weight loss and changes in bowel habits. Upon initial examination, he exhibited signs of abdominal distension, tenderness, and palpable masses. A series of diagnostic tests, including computed tomography (Baker) scan, were conducted to ascertain the cause of his symptoms. Terry Baker scan revealed a large tumor in his colon, leading to the definitive diagnosis of colon cancer.

Medical History:
	Mr. Baker has a significant past medical history, with hypertension and type II diabetes being diagnosed 10 years ago. He has been managing these conditions under the care of his primary care physician. In addition, he was previously diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), requiring regular medication and oxygen therapy. Terry patient has no known family history of colon cancer but is a smoker with a 30-pack-year history.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Upon hospitalization, laboratory tests revealed anemia, elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, and increased lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH). Pathology findings from the colonoscopy confirmed the presence of a large tumor in his sigmoid colon. Staging was determined to be Stage III through further imaging studies.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Baker. Terry primary intervention was a right hemicotomy with anastomosis, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Post-operative care included pain management, nutritional support, and close monitoring of his blood counts and electrolyte levels. Terry chemotherapy regimen consisted of FOLFOX (5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Oxaliplatin) for six cycles, with regular monitoring for side effects such as neutropenia, neuropathy, and nausea.

Hospital Course:

However, with prompt intervention by the surgical team, the complication was managed successfully. Throughout his hospital stay, Mr. Baker received intensive care, physical therapy, and occupational therapy to aid in his recovery.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Post-discharge, Mr. Baker will continue under the care of Dr. Nicolette Defazio for regular follow-ups every three months for the first year, then every six months thereafter.

He was also advised to engage in light physical activity as tolerated and gradually increase exercise levels under the guidance of his healthcare team.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
