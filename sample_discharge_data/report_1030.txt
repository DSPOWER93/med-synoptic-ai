Reason for Admission:
	Charles Cummings presented with symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss, and changes in bowel habits. Upon initial assessment, a mass was palpable in the lower abdomen. Further diagnostic investigations including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and colonoscopy confirmed a tumor in the sigmoid colon with lymph node involvement, suggesting Charles Cummings colorectal cancer.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology reports confirmed the presence of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the sigmoid colon with involved lymph nodes. CT scan and MRI revealed a large, irregular mass in the lower abdomen, with multiple enlarged lymph nodes. Blood tests showed elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and anemia.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Charles Cummings. He underwent a sigmoid colectomy, with formation of an ileal conduit followed by post-operative care. Additionally, he received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil) for six cycles and radiation therapy to the pelvis for five sessions. Management of side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, and neutropenia was also part of the plan.

Hospital Course:
	Charles Cummings's initial recovery from surgery was uneventful; however, he experienced delayed wound healing due to his underlying conditions. Aggressive wound care and nutritional support were provided. He tolerated chemotherapy well, with management of side effects as needed.

This included medication adherence instructions, wound care practices, hydration guidelines, and physical activity restrictions. He was also provided written information about the signs of complications and when to seek medical attention.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial in Charles Cummings's long-term care plan. He will need to manage ongoing health issues such as hypertension, diabetes, and COPD effectively.
