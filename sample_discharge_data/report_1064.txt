Patient Information:
	•Name: Nichole Allen
	•Date of Birth: 12/05/1980
	•Medical Record Number: M1064
	•Date of Admission: 08/15/2022
	•Date of Discharge: 09/07/2022
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Corey Sansone
	•Primary Diagnosis: Transitional Cell Carcinoma (TCC), Urinary Bladder

Reason for Admission:
	Nichole Allen was admitted to our facility on 08/15/2022 due to persistent hematuria, abdominal pain, and frequent urination. The initial assessment revealed that he was in moderate distress with a hemoglobin level of 9.5g/dL. A thorough examination followed by abdominal and pelvic ultrasound confirmed the presence of a mass in his urinary bladder. Subsequent cystoscopy and biopsy revealed the diagnosis of Nichole Allen Carcinoma (TCC), urging immediate intervention.

Medical History:
	Nichole Allen has a significant medical history, including hypertension, managed with lisinopril 10mg daily, type 2 diabetes mellitus controlled with metformin 850mg twice daily, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), for which he was using a combination of inhaled bronchodilators. He underwent a laparotomy for gallstone removal in 2017. He has no known allergies, but a history of an adverse reaction to morphine during a previous hospitalization.

Diagnostic Findings:
	The diagnostic tests conducted during Nichole Allen's hospital stay included cystoscopy, biopsy, computed tomography (CT) urogram, and positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The pathology report confirmed the presence of a high-grade TCC with involvement of the muscularis propria but no evidence of lymph node or distant metastasis. Blood tests showed elevated creatinine (1.5mg/dL), and slightly increased alkaline phosphatase (74U/L).

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Nichole Allen, which included radical cystectomy with ileal conduit diversion, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The patient underwent surgery on 08/25/2022, followed by an uneventful recovery period. He began a 6-cycle platinum-based chemotherapy regimen starting on 09/10/2022, with a decision to defer radiation therapy until completion of chemotherapy due to its potential impact on wound healing.

Hospital Course:
	During his hospital stay, Nichole Allen made a satisfactory recovery from the surgery, exhibiting good adherence to post-operative care instructions. He faced challenges with nutritional intake but was successfully managed with supplements and enteral feeding for a short duration. The disease was effectively controlled during his hospitalization, with regular cystoscopy and urinalysis.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Post-discharge, Nichole Allen is scheduled to follow up with the oncology team every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months thereafter. He will continue the same medications (lisinopril, metformin, and bronchodilators) and will be started on tamsulosin for bladder spasm. He has been instructed to maintain a low-fiber diet, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activities during the initial recovery phase.

Patient Education:
	Nichole Allen and his family were provided extensive education about the treatment options, post-surgical care, managing the ileal conduit, recognizing signs of complications, and managing common side effects such as fatigue, neuropathy, and nausea.

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, Nichole Allen was provided clear instructions on medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration, and physical activity guidelines. He was also instructed to report any signs of infection, fever, or unusual changes in urine color or volume.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial for Nichole Allen's long-term health. It is essential that he maintains a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.

Final Remarks:
	Nichole Allen displayed remarkable resilience throughout his treatment journey, cooperating fully with the medical team. His positive attitude and determination have played a significant role in his recovery thus far. This report is signed by Dr. Corey Sansone on 09/07/2022, validating the comprehensive documentation of Nichole Allen's care.
