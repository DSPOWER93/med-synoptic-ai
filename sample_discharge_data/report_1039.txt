Patient Information:
	•Name: Eric Williams
	•Date of Birth: 12/01/1985
	•Medical Record Number: M1039
	•Date of Admission: 03/01/2023
	•Date of Discharge: 10/01/2023
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Rodney Bathe
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer (Stage III)

Reason for Admission:
	Mr. Williams presented to the emergency department with persistent abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, and unexplained weight loss over the past three months. Initial assessment included a physical examination, which revealed abnormalities in the lower abdomen. Subsequent diagnostic investigations, including computed tomography (CT) scan, colonoscopy, and biopsy, confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the colon.

Medical History:
	Mr. Williams has a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled with medication. He also has a family history of colorectal cancer, with his father being diagnosed at the age of 60. Previously, he underwent appendectomy in 2010 and has allergies to penicillin and sulfa drugs. His pre-admission medications included amlodipine (for hypertension) and metformin (for diabetes).

Diagnostic Findings:
	The pathology report confirmed the presence of a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the sigmoid colon. The CT scan showed a large mass in the sigmoid colon, with regional lymph node involvement. Blood tests revealed anemia and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Williams. He underwent a sigmoid colectomy, followed by a loop ileostomy. The post-operative care included pain management, intravenous fluid replacement, and nutritional support. Mr. Williams was also prescribed adjuvant chemotherapy, with the regimen consisting of FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil) for six cycles. Radiation therapy was not deemed necessary due to the extent of surgical resection.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Williams's initial recovery from surgery was smooth, with no significant complications. However, he experienced several side effects from chemotherapy, including fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. These were managed effectively through medication and supportive care. Therapy and nutritional support played a crucial role in his recovery.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Mr. Williams will be scheduled for regular follow-up appointments every three months for the first year, then every six months thereafter. He will continue on adjuvant chemotherapy as prescribed and maintain a low-fiber diet to manage his ileostomy. Lifestyle changes, including regular exercise and quitting smoking, are strongly recommended. Any sudden changes in bowel habits or persistent abdominal pain should be reported immediately.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Williams and his family were educated about the importance of adhering to the prescribed medication regimen, proper ileostomy care, and recognizing signs of complications such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or persistent diarrhea. They were also advised on managing common side effects like fatigue and nausea.

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Williams was provided with detailed instructions on medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration, and physical activity guidelines. He was also given a stoma care kit and instructed to contact the stoma nurse if he has any concerns.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial. Mr. Williams's long-term health will be managed by addressing ongoing issues like hypertension and diabetes.

Final Remarks:
	Dr. Bathe commends Mr. Williams for his resilience and cooperation throughout the treatment journey. She encourages him to continue with the prescribed regimen and lifestyle changes for optimal health outcomes. Both the physician and patient sign the report, validating its accuracy and completeness.
