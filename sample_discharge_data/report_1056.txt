Allergies include penicillin, sulfa drugs, and contrast media. Mr. Thorpe was taking metformin, lisinopril, and albuterol before admission.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology report confirmed the presence of invasive transitional cell carcinoma in the bladder tissue. Imaging studies, including a CT scan and MRI, showed that the tumor had invaded the muscularis propria layer. Blood tests indicated elevated creatinine levels, suggesting potential renal impairment due to the tumor.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a treatment plan for Mr. Thorpe. This included a radical cystectomy with ileal conduit formation, followed by six cycles of chemotherapy (GCB Gemcitabine, Cisplatin, and BCG). He was also to receive radiation therapy post-operatively.

His medications include metformin (500mg twice daily), lisinopril (10mg once daily), albuterol inhaler as needed, and antibiotics as prescribed. He has been instructed to maintain a low-fiber diet and drink plenty of water to facilitate urine flow.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Thorpe and his family were educated about the importance of recognizing signs of infection or complications related to the ileal conduit. They were also instructed on how to care for the wound, manage side effects such as fatigue and nausea, and monitor for renal function changes.
