Patient Information:
	•Name: Francis Smalls
	•Date of Birth: 01/01/1970
	•Medical Record Number: M1027
	•Date of Admission: 03/15/2022
	•Date of Discharge: 05/20/2022
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Mary Vargas
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer (Stage III)

Reason for Admission:
	Mr. Francis Smalls, a 52-year-old male, was admitted to our facility due to persistent lower abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, and changes in bowel habits over the past three months. The initial assessment revealed a palpable mass in the lower abdomen, and laboratory tests indicated anemia and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Further investigations, including computed tomography (CT) scan, confirmed the suspicion of colorectal cancer.

Medical History:
	Mr. Smalls has a significant medical history, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He underwent a cholecystectomy in 2005 and is allergic to penicillin. His family history is notable for colorectal cancer, with his father diagnosed at age 65. Prior to admission, Mr. Smalls was taking metformin, lisinopril, salmeterol, and fluticasone.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Surgical resection of the tumor revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the muscularis propria. Pathology staging was T3N1M0 (Stage III). Imaging studies showed no distant metastases, and CEA levels were elevated at 12.5 ng/mL. Blood tests also revealed mild anemia (Hb 9 g/dL) and elevated liver function tests (ALT 78 U/L, AST 65 U/L).

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a treatment plan for Mr. Smalls, which included a right hemicolectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Post-operative care involved pain management, wound dressing changes, and nutritional support. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of FOLFOX (Folinic acid, 5-Fluorouracil, and Oxaliplatin) every two weeks for six cycles. Radiation therapy was considered for potential local recurrence.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Smalls underwent a successful right hemicolectomy on March 20, 2022. Post-operative recovery was uneventful, and the patient tolerated chemotherapy well. However, he experienced moderate neutropenia during the first cycle, which was managed with appropriate support. Mr. Smalls's condition stabilized, and he maintained a positive attitude throughout his hospital stay.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Post-discharge, Mr. Smalls will return for regular follow-up appointments every three months for the first year, then every six months thereafter. He will continue taking metformin and lisinopril but discontinue salmeterol and fluticasone as he recovers from surgery. A low-fiber, high-protein diet is recommended to minimize complications associated with the ileal conduit. Mr. Smalls should also monitor for warning signs such as fever, persistent abdominal pain, or rectal bleeding.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Smalls and his family were thoroughly educated about colorectal cancer, treatment options, and post-surgical care. They were instructed on managing the ileal conduit, recognizing signs of complications, and coping with common side effects such as fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Smalls was provided clear instructions regarding medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration, and physical activity guidelines. He was advised to take the prescribed medications as directed, maintain a balanced diet, and avoid strenuous activities until fully recovered.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is essential for Mr. Smalls's long-term survival. Adherence to the follow-up plan and lifestyle modifications are critical in managing ongoing health issues related to his medical history.

Final Remarks:
	Mr. Francis Smalls demonstrated exceptional resilience throughout his treatment journey, and I am confident that he will continue to adapt positively as he recovers at home. I wish him a swift and successful recovery, and we look forward to seeing him in follow-up appointments.
