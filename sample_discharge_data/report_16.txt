Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Murray, which included a partial colectomy, creation of an ileal conduit, six cycles of FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil) chemotherapy, and radiation therapy to the affected lymph nodes. Post-operative care involved pain management, wound care, and nutritional support.
