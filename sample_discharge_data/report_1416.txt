Patient Information:
	•Name: Robert Brown
	•Date of Birth: 12/04/1985
	•Medical Record Number: M1416
	•Date of Admission: 03/07/2022
	•Date of Discharge: 06/10/2022
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Melanie Ellis
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer (Stage III)

Reason for Admission:
	Robert Brown, a 37-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital due to persistent abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, and unexplained weight loss over a period of three months. Upon initial assessment, he presented with signs of anemia and abnormalities in his complete blood count (CBC). Further investigations, including a computed tomography (CT) scan, revealed a mass in the lower right quadrant of his abdomen. Subsequent colonoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

Medical History:
	Mr. Brown has a history of hypertension and is currently on medication for blood pressure control. He also has a family history of colorectal cancer, with his father being diagnosed at age 60. Additionally, he was previously diagnosed with COPD due to long-term tobacco use. He had no known allergies and was not taking any significant medications before admission.

Diagnostic Findings:
	The pathology report from the surgical resection of the primary tumor indicated a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, with lymph node involvement. Imaging scans showed no evidence of distant metastasis, but the tumor was locally advanced. His CBC revealed anemia (hemoglobin 8.5 g/dL), and liver function tests were slightly elevated.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Brown. He underwent a right hemicolectomy, followed by a permanent ileal conduit creation. Post-operative care included pain management, wound care, and nutritional support. He was also initiated on adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of FOLFOX regimen (Folinic acid, Fluorouracil, and Oxaliplatin) for six cycles. Due to the risk of recurrence in the liver, radiation therapy was considered but ultimately deferred due to Mr. Brown's overall health condition.

Hospital Course:
	Following surgery, Mr. Brown recovered well with minimal complications. He faced challenges during chemotherapy, experiencing nausea, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. However, these side effects were managed effectively through medication adjustments and supportive care. Regular follow-ups with the oncology team and rehabilitation therapy helped him regain his strength and mobility.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Post-discharge, Mr. Brown will have regular follow-up appointments every three months for the first year, then six-monthly thereafter. He will continue with the prescribed chemotherapy for the full duration of six cycles. Dietary recommendations include a high-fiber diet and adequate hydration. Lifestyle modifications such as quitting smoking and regular exercise are also strongly advised. In case of any signs of recurrence (e.g., persistent abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, unexplained weight loss), immediate medical attention is required.

Patient Education:
	The patient was educated about the importance of adhering to his medication schedule, proper ileal conduit care, recognizing signs of complications (e.g., fever, abdominal distension), and managing common side effects such as fatigue and nausea.

Discharge Instructions:
	Prior to discharge, Mr. Brown was provided with detailed instructions on medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration guidelines, and physical activity recommendations. He was also given educational materials and resources for further understanding of his condition and treatment options.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial to improve the chances of successful treatment. Managing ongoing health issues such as hypertension and COPD will also be essential in maintaining Mr. Brown's overall health.

Final Remarks:
	Mr. Brown demonstrated remarkable resilience throughout his treatment journey, cooperating fully with the medical team and following their recommendations diligently. We congratulate him on his successful surgery and wish him a speedy recovery. Sincerely, Dr. Melanie Ellis [Date]
