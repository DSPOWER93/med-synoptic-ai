Patient Information:
	•Name: Rachel Charles
	•Date of Birth: 01/01/1980
	•Medical Record Number: M1007
	•Date of Admission: 01/01/2022
	•Date of Discharge: 10/02/2022
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Beverly Clark
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer, Stage III

Reason for Admission:
	Rachel Charles was admitted to our facility due to persistent lower abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and unintentional weight loss over the past three months. Initial assessment revealed a palpable mass in the lower abdomen, and laboratory tests showed elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Computed tomography (CT) scan and colonoscopy confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the descending colon.

Medical History:
	Mr. Charles has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He underwent a left laparotomy for appendicitis in 2015. His family history is significant for colorectal cancer. Allergies include penicillin, and he was taking metformin, lisinopril, albuterol, and ipratropium before admission.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology report from the tumor resection revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with lymph node involvement. CT scan showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mesocolon and liver metastases. Blood tests also indicated anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase.

Treatment Plan:
	The multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan. Surgical intervention involved a left hemicolectomy with primary ileo-sigmoid anastomosis. Post-operative care included pain management, nutritional support, and monitoring for complications such as anastomotic leakage. Adjuvant chemotherapy was initiated using Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin in a 3-week cycle with a total of 12 cycles planned. Radiation therapy was not deemed necessary.

Hospital Course:
	During his hospital stay, Mr. Charles showed signs of recovery from surgery, but faced challenges due to complications related to COPD exacerbation and anemia. He received antibiotics for infection and steroids for respiratory support. Nutritional therapy was also implemented to aid in weight gain.

Follow-Up Plan:
	The follow-up plan includes scheduled outpatient appointments every three months for the first year, then every six months thereafter. Continuation of Capecitabine is advised for a total of 12 cycles. Lifestyle modifications include smoking cessation and a high-fiber diet. Warning signs of recurrence or complications require immediate medical attention.

Patient Education:
	The patient and his family were educated about post-surgical care, management of the ileal conduit, recognizing signs of complications such as obstruction or leakage, and managing common side effects like diarrhea and neuropathy.

Discharge Instructions:
	Discharge instructions include medication adherence, proper wound care practices, adequate hydration, and guidelines for physical activity.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial. It is essential to manage ongoing health issues such as diabetes and COPD effectively to improve overall prognosis.

Final Remarks:
	Rachel Charles has shown remarkable resilience throughout his treatment journey, cooperating fully with the care team. We wish him a speedy recovery and continued good health.
