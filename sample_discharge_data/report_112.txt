	•Attending Physician: Dr. Terry Abel
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer (Stage IIIB)

Reason for Admission:
	Clarence Stephens, a 37-year-old male, was admitted to our facility due to persistent lower abdominal pain and rectal bleeding that had been ongoing for over a month. Upon initial assessment, his vital signs were stable but he exhibited signs of anemia. Further investigations including CT scans, MRI, and colonoscopy confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the descending colon.

Medical History:
	Mr. Stephens has a history of hypertension, which is currently well-controlled with medication. He also has a 20-year history of diabetes managed through diet and insulin therapy. He underwent appendectomy in 2015 and his father died from colorectal cancer at the age of 60. Mr. Stephens was taking metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin before admission.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology report confirmed adenocarcinoma in the descending colon. The CT scan revealed a large tumor measuring approximately 8cm x 6cm in size, with lymph node involvement. His hemoglobin level was 7.5g/dL, which is indicative of anemia.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Stephens. This included a partial colectomy followed by a formation of an ileal conduit. Post-operative care involved the management of pain, wound healing, and prevention of complications such as infection. He was also initiated on adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX) with 6 cycles planned, along with radiation therapy to the pelvic region for residual disease.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Stephens's initial recovery from surgery was smooth, but he faced challenges with maintaining adequate nutritional intake due to nausea and loss of appetite. He underwent several sessions of radiation therapy and completed the first cycle of chemotherapy. His symptoms were managed effectively, and he responded well to treatment.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Mr. Stephens will be scheduled for regular follow-up appointments every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months thereafter. He will continue with the prescribed chemotherapy regimen and undergo a CT scan every three months to monitor disease progression. Lifestyle recommendations include maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoidance of alcohol and tobacco.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Stephens and his family were provided comprehensive education about the treatment plan, post-surgical care, management of the ileal conduit, recognizing signs of complications, and managing common side effects such as fatigue, diarrhea, and neuropathy.

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Stephens was provided with detailed instructions on medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration, and physical activity guidelines. He was also given information about local support groups for colorectal cancer patients.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial. Mr. Stephens's prognosis is positive with appropriate follow-up care and adherence to the treatment plan.

Final Remarks:
	Dr. Terry Abel concludes, "Clarence Stephens has shown remarkable resilience throughout his treatment journey. His cooperation and determination have been instrumental in his recovery. We are confident that he will continue to make progress post-discharge." Both Dr. Abel and Clarence Stephens have signed this report on 02/28/2022, validating the documentation of his care.
