Reason for Admission:
	The patient, Jose Miller, presented with complaints of abdominal pain, weight loss, and altered bowel habits over the past six months. Upon initial assessment, he exhibited signs of anemia and a palpable mass in the lower abdomen. Further diagnostic investigations confirmed the presence of colorectal cancer. The extent of the disease was staged as IIIA.

Medical History:

He underwent a cholecystectomy five years ago due to gallstones. John has a family history of colorectal cancer, with his father being diagnosed at age 65. He is not known to have any allergies and was taking metformin, lisinopril, and salmeterol before admission.

Diagnostic Findings:
	The diagnostic workup included a series of laboratory tests, a colonoscopy, CT scans, and MRI of the abdomen and pelvis. Pathology reports confirmed the presence of adenocarcinoma in the sigmoid colon. Imaging studies revealed the primary tumor along with lymph node involvement. Blood tests showed elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

Treatment Plan:
	The multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Jose Miller, which included a sigmoid colon resection with primary anastomosis followed by systemic chemotherapy. Post-operative care involved close monitoring for complications such as anastomotic leak and infection. John underwent a six-month regimen of FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy with scheduled breaks during the course of treatment. A decision was made to refrain from radiation therapy due to potential complications given his COPD.

Hospital Course:

His medications will continue as prescribed, with adjustments made based on his response to treatment and any adverse effects. A low-fiber diet is recommended to minimize discomfort related to his ileal conduit.

Patient Education:

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, Jose Miller was provided with detailed instructions on medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration guidelines, and physical activity recommendations to ensure his continued recovery and health maintenance.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is essential in managing John's ongoing health issues. Close collaboration between the oncologist, primary care physician, and other specialists will help optimize his treatment plan.

Final Remarks:
	Dr. Dr. Wilson concludes the report by expressing her appreciation for Jose Miller's resilience and cooperation throughout the treatment journey. She emphasizes the importance of continued follow-up and encourages him to maintain a positive attitude in the face of this challenge.
