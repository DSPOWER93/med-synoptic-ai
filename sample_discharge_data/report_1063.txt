Patient Information:
	•Name: Opal Jones
	•Date of Birth: 01/01/1985
	•Medical Record Number: M1063
	•Date of Admission: 04/02/2023
	•Date of Discharge: 04/15/2023
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Christi Weatherall
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer, Stage III

Reason for Admission:
	Opal Jones was admitted to the hospital due to persistent abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, and unexplained weight loss over the past three months. His initial assessment revealed a palpable mass in the lower abdomen, with laboratory tests indicating anemia and elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Subsequent imaging scans, including computed tomography (CT) scan and colonoscopy, confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the sigmoid colon.

Medical History:
	Opal Jones has a history of hypertension, which is managed with medication. He also has a family history of colorectal cancer, as his father passed away from the disease at age 60. Prior to admission, he had undergone a cholecystectomy in 2018. John has no known allergies and was taking lisinopril (5mg) daily for hypertension control before admission.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology report from the colon biopsy confirmed the presence of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Imaging studies showed a large tumor in the sigmoid colon, with lymph node involvement. Blood tests indicated anemia (Hb 9g/dL) and elevated CEA levels (12.3ng/mL).

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team of specialists developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Opal Jones. He underwent a sigmoid colectomy, with formation of an ileal conduit, followed by four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (FOLFOX regimen). Radiation therapy was deemed unnecessary due to the absence of distant metastasis.

Hospital Course:
	Opal Jones's initial recovery from surgery was uneventful, but he experienced post-operative ileus, which required bowel rest and nasogastric suction for a few days. Subsequent challenges included managing chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and nephrotoxicity. He received supportive care, including intravenous hydration, antibiotics, and antiemetics. Nutritional support was provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

Follow-Up Plan:
	Opal Jones is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Dr. Weatherall in one week. He will continue taking lisinopril and leucovorin, while his 5-FU dosage will be adjusted based on blood tests. He is advised to maintain a balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, while limiting processed foods and red meat. Opal Jones should report any signs of complications, such as fever, persistent abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.

Patient Education:
	Opal Jones and his family were educated on the importance of post-surgical care, including ileal conduit management, recognizing signs of complications, and managing common side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. They were also provided with resources for emotional support during this challenging time.

Discharge Instructions:
	Opal Jones was discharged home with instructions to continue taking prescribed medications, maintain strict wound care practices, and monitor his stoma output for changes. He was advised to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water daily, unless otherwise instructed by his healthcare provider. Light physical activity is recommended once he feels capable, starting with short walks.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	The prognosis for Opal Jones is good, as he has undergone a curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. However, regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial, and Opal Jones should maintain a healthy lifestyle to manage ongoing health issues associated with his history of hypertension.

Final Remarks:
	I am impressed by Opal Jones's resilience and cooperation throughout this challenging treatment journey. His positive attitude and dedication to following the recommended care plan have contributed significantly to his successful recovery thus far. We will continue to closely monitor his progress and adjust his treatment as needed.
