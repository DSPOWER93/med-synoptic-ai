Patient Information:
	•Name: Randall Herz
	•Date of Birth: 01/15/1980
	•Medical Record Number: M1149
	•Date of Admission: 03/22/2022
	•Date of Discharge: 04/12/2022
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Courtney Taylor
	•Primary Diagnosis: Stage III Colorectal Cancer (CRC)

Reason for Admission:
	Randall Herz was admitted to our facility following a series of symptoms including unexplained weight loss, persistent abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding. Upon initial assessment, he appeared pale, weak, and had a palpable mass in the lower abdomen. A series of diagnostic tests were conducted, which confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the colon.

Medical History:
	Mr. Herz has a history of hypertension, which is managed with medication. He was recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and was on insulin therapy. He has chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for which he uses an inhaler regularly. Mr. Herz has a family history of CRC, with his father having passed away from the same disease at age 65. He is not known to have any allergies and was on a variety of medications before admission.

Diagnostic Findings:
	A series of diagnostic tests were conducted including colonoscopy, CT scan, MRI, and blood tests. The pathology report from the surgically removed tumor confirmed it as adenocarcinoma of the rectum. Blood tests revealed elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a marker for CRC.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Herz. He underwent an abdominoperineal resection, a surgical procedure to remove the colon and rectum, followed by formation of an ileal conduit. Post-operative care included pain management, wound care, and nutritional support. He received adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX regimen (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil) for six cycles to reduce the risk of recurrence. The decision on radiation therapy will be made during the follow-up appointments.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Herz's initial recovery from surgery was challenging due to post-operative complications such as anastomotic leakage and wound infection, which were managed with antibiotics and drainage. However, he responded well to treatment and was gradually able to resume normal activity levels.

Follow-Up Plan:
	A comprehensive follow-up plan has been designed for Mr. Herz. This includes regular outpatient appointments every three months for the first two years, then every six months thereafter. His medications will be adjusted as necessary based on his blood sugar control and electrolyte levels. He is advised to maintain a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. He must also avoid alcohol and smoking.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Herz and his family were educated about the nature of CRC, treatment options, and post-surgical care. They were instructed on managing the ileal conduit, recognizing signs of complications such as fever, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits, and managing common side effects like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Discharge Instructions:
	Mr. Herz was provided with clear discharge instructions to ensure his continued recovery and health maintenance. He was advised to strictly adhere to his medication schedule, practice good wound care, maintain adequate hydration, and engage in light physical activity as tolerated.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial for Mr. Herz's long-term survival. He will also need to manage ongoing health issues such as diabetes and hypertension effectively.

Final Remarks:
	In conclusion, Mr. Randall Herz has shown remarkable resilience throughout his treatment journey. His cooperation, coupled with the multidisciplinary approach of our team, has led to a successful surgical intervention and a positive prognosis. We look forward to continued collaboration in ensuring his long-term health and wellbeing.
