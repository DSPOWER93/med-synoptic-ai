Patient Information:
	•Name: James Hamilton
	•Date of Birth: 01/01/1975
	•Medical Record Number: M1090
	•Date of Admission: 04/01/2023
	•Date of Discharge: 08/01/2023
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Neil Harrod
	•Primary Diagnosis: Stage III Colorectal Cancer

Reason for Admission:
	James Hamilton was admitted to the hospital due to persistent lower abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits over a period of six weeks. Initial assessment revealed tenderness in the lower abdomen, palpable mass, and unintentional weight loss. Subsequent diagnostic investigations, including a CT scan and colonoscopy, confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the descending colon.

Medical History:
	James Hamilton has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has had two previous surgeries appendectomy at age 10 and a left inguinal hernia repair at age 25. His family history is significant for colorectal cancer and breast cancer. Allergies include penicillin and iodinated contrast agents. Pre-admission medications included metformin, lisinopril, and albuterol inhaler.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology results from the colonoscopy confirmed adenocarcinoma of the descending colon. CT scan revealed a 7cm mass in the descending colon with involvement of nearby lymph nodes. Blood tests showed elevated levels of CEA (Carcinoembryonic Antigen) and CA19-9, indicative of colorectal cancer.

Treatment Plan:
	The multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Hamilton. This included a partial colectomy with a permanent ileostomy, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Post-operative care involved pain management, wound care, nutritional support, and monitoring of bowel function. Chemotherapy was initiated in the form of FOLFOX regimen (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil), with six cycles planned. Radiation therapy was not deemed necessary at this stage due to the extent of the disease.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Hamilton underwent a successful partial colectomy and ileostomy on 05/01/2023. The initial recovery phase was challenging, marked by severe pain, nausea, and diarrhea. However, with appropriate pain management and aggressive symptom control, he gradually improved. His condition stabilized, and his vital signs remained within normal limits throughout the hospital stay.

Follow-Up Plan:
	The follow-up plan includes scheduled outpatient appointments every three months for the first year, followed by semi-annual visits thereafter. Medications to be continued include metformin (modified dose due to renal function impairment), lisinopril, and albuterol inhaler. Lifestyle modifications include a low-fat, high-fiber diet, regular exercise, and avoidance of smoking and alcohol. Warning signs requiring immediate medical attention include fever, severe abdominal pain, or rectal bleeding.

Patient Education:
	The patient and his family were provided extensive education on post-surgical care, including ileostomy management, signs of complications, and managing common side effects such as fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.

Discharge Instructions:
	Discharge instructions focus on medication adherence, wound care practices (including skin cleansing, irrigation, and dressing changes), hydration, and physical activity guidelines.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial. Mr. Hamilton will be closely followed to manage ongoing health issues related to his comorbidities.

Final Remarks:
	Dr. Harrod expressed her appreciation for James Hamilton's resilience and cooperation throughout the treatment journey. She emphasized the importance of following the recommended plan for continued recovery and emphasized that the next few months will be critical in his fight against colorectal cancer. Signed Dr. Neil Harrod, MD (08/01/2023). James Hamilton also signed the report to validate his understanding of the provided information and treatment plan.
