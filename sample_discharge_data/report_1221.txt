Patient Information:
	•Name: Matthew Peterson
	•Date of Birth: 01/15/1978
	•Medical Record Number: M1221
	•Date of Admission: 03/10/2023
	•Date of Discharge: 05/15/2023
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Everett Gaskins
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer (Stage III)

Reason for Admission:
	Matthew Peterson presented to the emergency department with persistent lower abdominal pain, bloating, and change in bowel habits over a period of three weeks. An initial assessment revealed that he had been experiencing unintended weight loss, fatigue, and decreased appetite. Subsequent diagnostic investigations, including a colonoscopy, CT scan, and blood tests, confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the sigmoid colon.

Medical History:
	Mr. Peterson has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He underwent a cholecystectomy for gallstones in 2015. His father died of colon cancer at the age of 63, and his sister is a breast cancer survivor. Prior to admission, he was taking metformin, lisinopril, amlodipine, albuterol, ipratropium bromide, and atorvastatin.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology results revealed an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon with positive lymph nodes. Imaging scans showed that the tumor had invaded adjacent organs. Blood tests indicated elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and anemia.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team, including oncologists, surgeons, and radiotherapists, developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Peterson. He underwent a sigmoid colectomy with primary ileo-rectal anastomosis followed by a temporary loop ileostomy due to tumor proximity to the rectum. Postoperative care involved monitoring for complications, nutritional support, and management of pain. A six-month course of adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX regimen was initiated, along with radiation therapy to the abdomen and pelvis.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Peterson's initial recovery from surgery was uneventful, but he faced challenges due to side effects from chemotherapy and radiation therapy, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, and skin irritation. His condition improved with supportive care and medication management. During his hospital stay, he also received physical therapy to maintain mobility and strength.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Peterson will undergo regular follow-up appointments every three months for the first two years, then every six months thereafter. He will continue taking metformin, lisinopril, amlodipine, albuterol, ipratropium bromide, and atorvastatin, with adjustments as needed. Dietary recommendations include a balanced diet low in fiber to minimize discomfort related to the ileal conduit. He should report any signs of complications, such as fever, persistent abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Peterson and his family were educated about post-surgical care, management of the ileal conduist, recognizing signs of complications, and managing common side effects from chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He was also informed about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and diet to promote long-term health.

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Peterson received comprehensive discharge instructions detailing medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration, and physical activity guidelines. He was advised to maintain a balanced diet low in fiber, monitor his weight, and report any signs of complications to his healthcare team.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	The prognosis for colorectal cancer depends on various factors, including the stage at diagnosis and response to treatment. Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is essential, as well as managing ongoing health issues related to diabetes, hypertension, and COPD.

Final Remarks:
	Dr. Everett Gaskins expressed her appreciation for Mr. Peterson's resilience and cooperation throughout his treatment journey. She emphasized the importance of regular follow-up appointments and adhering to the discharge instructions to ensure a successful long-term recovery. The report is signed by Dr. Everett Gaskins on May 15, 2023.
