Initial assessment revealed a palpable mass in his abdomen and abnormal results from routine blood tests, prompting further investigations.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Upon admission, John underwent various diagnostic tests including CT scans, MRI, and a biopsy of the renal tumor. Pathology reports confirmed the diagnosis of advanced RCC with metastatic spread to the liver and lungs. Blood tests revealed anemia, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for John Terry. He underwent nephrectomy followed by partial hepatectomy to remove the affected portions of his kidney and liver. Post-operative care included management of pain, fluid and electrolyte balance, and nutritional support.

Follow-Up Plan:
	John Terry will be followed up in the outpatient clinic every three months for the first year post-discharge, then every six months thereafter. He will continue sunitinib and undergo regular imaging studies to monitor disease progression. A low-sodium diet is recommended due to his history of hypertension, and he should maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise.
