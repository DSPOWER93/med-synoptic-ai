Patient Information:
	•Name: Leona Lindquist
	•Date of Birth: 01/01/1975
	•Medical Record Number: M1023
	•Date of Admission: 03/01/2022
	•Date of Discharge: 15/01/2022
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Laura Lynch
	•Primary Diagnosis: Adenocarcinoma of the Rectum (Stage III)

Reason for Admission:
	Leona Lindquist was admitted to our facility due to a rapidly progressing abdominal mass, accompanied by rectal bleeding, and significant weight loss over the past two months. Initial physical examination revealed an enlarged and tender abdomen with palpable masses. Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and a positive fecal occult blood test. Subsequent diagnostic imaging, including a computed tomography (CT) scan, confirmed the presence of a large, invasive rectal tumor with regional lymph node involvement.

Medical History:
	Leona Lindquist is a 47-year-old male with a history of hypertension and COPD, both well-controlled with medications. He has no significant family history of malignancies but is a lifelong smoker. Prior to this admission, he had undergone appendectomy in 2015 and a left total knee arthroplasty in 2017. The patient was not allergic to any medications and was taking aspirin daily for his hypertension.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology results from the excised rectal mass confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Imaging studies revealed a large, heterogeneous tumor with irregular borders that invaded adjacent organs and extended into multiple lymph nodes. Blood tests showed anemia (Hb 9.0 g/dL) and elevated CEA levels (15.6 ng/mL).

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Lindquist, which included surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient underwent an abdominoperineal resection (APR) on 08/01/2022. The operation was successful, and the specimen showed clear margins. Post-operative care involved managing pain, preventing complications such as surgical site infections and ileus, and initiating bowel movements through a temporary ileostomy.

Hospital Course:
	

Follow-Up Plan:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Lindquist will be scheduled for regular outpatient follow-ups every three months during the first year, then every six months thereafter. Medications for his hypertension will be continued and adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal blood pressure control. Lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation, a balanced diet, and regular exercise are strongly recommended. The patient was educated on the importance of recognizing signs of complications related to his ileal conduit, such as abnormal drainage or unusual odor, and was instructed to seek immediate medical attention in such cases.

Patient Education:
	During his hospitalization, Mr. Lindquist received extensive education on his disease, treatment options, and post-surgical care. He was informed about the signs of complications related to his ileal conduit, how to manage common side effects such as diarrhea and abdominal pain, and the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and adequate hydration.

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Lindquist was provided with detailed instructions on medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration guidelines, and physical activity recommendations. He was also given information about local support groups and resources for cancer survivors.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	The prognosis for patients with Stage III rectal cancer depends on the extent of initial tumor invasion, lymph node involvement, and response to adjuvant therapy. Mr. Lindquist's overall survival is estimated at 60% at five years. Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence and management of ongoing health issues are essential components of his long-term care plan.

Final Remarks:
	Mr. Lindquist demonstrated remarkable resilience and cooperation throughout the treatment journey. His family and support network played a crucial role in his recovery, providing emotional strength and practical assistance during his hospitalization. This report is signed by Dr. Laura Lynch (Oncologist) on 15/01/2022, validating the details of Mr. Lindquist's treatment plan and care instructions.
