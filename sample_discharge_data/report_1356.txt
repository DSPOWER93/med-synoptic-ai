Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Rosenfield. He underwent a Whipple procedure, followed by 6 cycles of FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. Radiation therapy was not deemed necessary based on the disease stage and response to surgery. The post-operative care included nutritional support, pain management, and monitoring for complications.
