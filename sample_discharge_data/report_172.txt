Patient Information:
	•Name: Kim Brown
	•Date of Birth: 12/07/1985
	•Medical Record Number: M172
	•Date of Admission: 03/10/2021
	•Date of Discharge: 04/15/2021
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Thomas Zamudio
	•Primary Diagnosis: Bladder Cancer (T3N0M0)

Reason for Admission:
	Mr. Brown presented to the emergency department with a complaint of painful and frequent urination, persistent hematuria, and a palpable mass in his lower abdomen. His initial assessment revealed a distended bladder, and laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count and creatinine level. Subsequent imaging studies, including CT scan and cystoscopy, confirmed the diagnosis of bladder cancer.

Medical History:
	Mr. Brown has a past medical history significant for hypertension, controlled with lisinopril, and asthma, requiring intermittent use of albuterol inhaler. He also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was on daily inhalers prior to admission. Mr. Brown's father passed away from colon cancer at the age of 60, and his mother has type 2 diabetes. He is allergic to penicillin.

Diagnostic Findings:
	The pathology report following cystoscopic biopsy confirmed a high-grade urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Staging was determined as T3N0M0. Blood tests revealed anemia and slightly elevated creatinine levels, consistent with the presence of a large tumor obstructing urinary flow.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Brown. This included cystectomy, ileal conduit creation, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Post-operative care involved managing pain, preventing urinary tract infections, monitoring kidney function, and promoting bowel regularity. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of four cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin, with appropriate management of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and nephrotoxicity. Radiation therapy was not deemed necessary due to the early stage of the cancer.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Brown underwent a successful cystectomy and ileal conduit creation on 03/15/2021. Post-operative recovery was initially challenging due to complications related to anastomotic leakage, requiring drainage and antibiotic treatment. However, with the support of the nursing staff and therapy, Mr. Brown made a steady recovery. He was discharged on 04/15/2021, meeting the criteria for safe discharge.

Follow-Up Plan:
	A comprehensive follow-up plan has been designed for Mr. Brown. This includes scheduled outpatient appointments with his oncologist and urologist, continuation of lisinopril, regular monitoring of kidney function, and a low-salt diet to manage hypertension. He will also need to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and avoiding smoking.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Brown and his family were provided detailed instructions on post-surgical care, management of the ileal conduit, recognizing signs of complications such as infection or obstruction, and managing common side effects like fatigue and sexual dysfunction.

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Brown was provided with clear instructions regarding medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration guidelines, and physical activity recommendations. He was advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for the first six weeks post-surgery.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Mr. Brown's prognosis is favorable given the early stage of his cancer and successful surgical intervention. Regular monitoring will be crucial for early detection of recurrence and managing ongoing health issues such as hypertension and COPD.

Final Remarks:
	The attending physician, Dr. Thomas Zamudio, commends Mr. Brown's resilience and cooperation throughout the treatment journey. She emphasizes the importance of continued adherence to the follow-up plan for a favorable long-term outlook. This report is signed by both the patient, Kim Brown, and the attending physician, Dr. Thomas Zamudio, on 04/15/2021.
