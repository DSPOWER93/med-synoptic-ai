Patient Information:
	•Name: Janice Grenier
	•Date of Birth: 15 January, 1970
	•Medical Record Number: M119
	•Date of Admission: 10 February, 2022
	•Date of Discharge: 25 March, 2022
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Roberta Salais
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer (Stage III) with metastasis to the liver

Reason for Admission:
	The patient, Mr. Janice Grenier, was admitted to our facility due to persistent lower abdominal pain and unexplained weight loss of approximately 20 pounds over the past two months. Upon initial assessment, a palpable mass was detected in his lower abdomen, and laboratory tests revealed elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Subsequent imaging studies confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the sigmoid colon with liver metastases.

Medical History:
	Mr. Grenier has a history of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, both well-controlled with medication. He underwent a right total knee replacement surgery due to osteoarthritis ten years ago. His family history is significant for colorectal cancer in his father and brother. Mr. Grenier has known allergies to penicillin and sulfa drugs. Prior to admission, he was taking metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin daily.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology results from the colonoscopy and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Computed Tomography (CT) scans revealed a 6cm mass in the sigmoid colon with multiple liver metastases. The CEA levels were found to be significantly elevated at 13.2 ng/ml (normal range <5 ng/ml).

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Grenier. This included a partial colectomy followed by an ileal conduit, six cycles of FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen, and liver-directed radiation therapy. The patient was closely monitored for side effects such as neutropenia, diarrhea, and neuropathy.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Grenier underwent a successful partial colectomy on 17th February, followed by the formation of an ileal conduit. The post-operative period was initially challenging due to complications such as ileus and sepsis, requiring broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care. With the intervention of our dedicated nursing staff, physical therapy team, and dietitian, Mr. Grenier made a steady recovery. He received his first cycle of FOLFOX chemotherapy on 7th March and tolerated it well, with only mild neutropenia.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Grenier will be scheduled for outpatient appointments every three months for the first year, then six-monthly thereafter. He will continue to take metformin and lisinopril as prescribed, but his aspirin therapy has been stopped due to the risk of bleeding complications. A low-fiber, high-protein diet is recommended, along with regular physical activity. Any signs of fever, abdominal pain, or increased CEA levels warrant immediate medical attention.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Grenier and his family were thoroughly educated about the ileal conduit, its function, and care. They were also instructed on recognizing signs of complications such as leaks, obstruction, or infections. Common side effects of chemotherapy, including fatigue, nausea, and hair loss, were discussed, along with strategies for managing them.

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Grenier was provided detailed instructions on medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration, and physical activity guidelines. He was also given educational materials and contacts for support groups to aid in his recovery journey.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial in managing Mr. Grenier's condition. It is important that he maintains a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.

Final Remarks:
	We commend Mr. Janice Grenier for his resilience and cooperation throughout this challenging journey. We wish him a swift recovery and a bright future ahead. This report is validated by Dr. Roberta Salais on 25th March, 2022.
