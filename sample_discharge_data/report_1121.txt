Reason for Admission:
	Barbara Allyn presented to the emergency department with a two-week history of abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, and weight loss. Upon initial assessment, he exhibited signs of dehydration, abdominal distension, and tenderness. Routine laboratory investigations revealed anemia and elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Further diagnostic tests, including a computed tomography (CT) scan, confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the sigmoid colon with regional lymph node involvement.

Medical History:
	Barbara Allyn has a significant medical history, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in 2015. He is allergic to penicillin and has a family history of colorectal cancer. Before admission, he was taking metformin for diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, and albuterol for COPD.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology report confirmed the presence of adenocarcinoma in the sigmoid colon. The CT scan showed a large tumor measuring 6 cm, with involved regional lymph nodes. Blood tests revealed anemia (hemoglobin 9 g/dL), elevated CEA level (12 ng/mL), and mildly elevated liver function tests.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Barbara Allyn, which included surgical resection of the tumor, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He underwent a sigmoid colectomy with permanent ileostomy on 03/01/2022. Post-operative care focused on pain management, fluid and electrolyte balance, and preventing complications such as infection and anastomotic leakage. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil), with a total of 12 cycles planned.

Hospital Course:
	Barbara Allyn's hospital course was marked by an initial recovery from surgery, followed by challenges related to post-operative ileus and dehydration. He required intravenous fluids and nasogastric tube suction for a few days. Regular therapy sessions were initiated to improve his mobility and overall function. Nutritional support was provided through enteral feedings via the ileostomy.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Post-discharge, Barbara Allyn is scheduled for follow-up appointments with his oncologist every three months for the first year, then every six months thereafter. He will continue taking metformin, lisinopril, and albuterol, but will need to adjust his diabetes management regimen due to the ileostomy. Dietary recommendations include a low-residue diet with adequate fluid intake. Warning signs requiring immediate medical attention include fever, abdominal pain, persistent diarrhea, or change in stoma output.

Patient Education:
	Barbara Allyn and his family were provided extensive education on post-surgical care, ileostomy management, and recognizing signs of complications. They were instructed on managing common side effects such as fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. They were also educated on the importance of adhering to the prescribed medication regimen and maintaining a healthy lifestyle for long-term survival.

Discharge Instructions:
	Discharge instructions included detailed information on medication adherence, wound care practices for the ileostomy site, hydration guidelines, and physical activity recommendations. Barbara Allyn was advised to continue monitoring his blood sugar levels and using his inhaler as prescribed.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial for long-term survival. Barbara Allyn was counseled on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, balanced diet, and avoidance of tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption.
