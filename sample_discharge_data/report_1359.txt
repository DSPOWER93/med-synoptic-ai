	•Medical Record Number: M1359
	•Date of Admission: 06/12/2022
	•Date of Discharge: 01/01/2023
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Courtney Taylor
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer (Stage III)

Reason for Admission:
	The patient, Mr. Kathy Taylor, was admitted to the hospital due to persistent lower abdominal pain and a change in bowel habits for approximately two months. The initial assessment included a physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging scans (CT scan and colonoscopy). These investigations confirmed the presence of a large tumor in his sigmoid colon, suggesting colorectal cancer. The severity and progression of symptoms were assessed using the TNM staging system, which determined that Mr. Taylor had Kathy Taylor colorectal cancer.

Medical History:
	Mr. Taylor has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He underwent gallbladder removal surgery in 2015. His family has a history of colon cancer, which increased the risk of developing this disease. Mr. Taylor was allergic to penicillin and certain anesthetics. Prior to admission, he was taking medications for his hypertension, diabetes, and COPD.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology results from the surgical excision of the tumor confirmed the diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma. Imaging scans revealed extensive lymph node involvement (T4N2M0) and no signs of distant metastasis. Blood tests showed anemia, elevated CEA levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Taylor. This included surgical intervention (total colectomy with ileo-sigmoid anastomosis), post-operative care, adjuvant chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The patient underwent surgery on 07/12/2022, followed by a recovery period during which he faced challenges related to pain management, nutritional support, and wound care.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Taylor's condition stabilized post-surgery, and he began the recovery process. He required additional support from physical therapy and occupational therapy due to reduced mobility caused by his COPD. He was also provided nutritional support and hydration management to help with recovery. Throughout this period, he remained positive and cooperative, adhering to the treatment plan and following the advice of his healthcare team.

Follow-Up Plan:
	A follow-up plan has been designed for Mr. Taylor after discharge. This includes regular outpatient appointments every three months for the first year, then every six months thereafter. Medications for hypertension, diabetes, and COPD will be continued, with adjustments made as necessary. Lifestyle recommendations include quitting smoking, maintaining a balanced diet, and engaging in regular exercise. The patient has been instructed to monitor for signs of complications such as fever, persistent diarrhea, and pain at the surgical site.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Taylor was educated about his condition, treatment options, and post-surgical care. He was taught how to manage the ileal conduit, recognize signs of complications, and manage common side effects such as diarrhea and fatigue. His family was also provided with information and support during this process.

Discharge Instructions:
	Discharge instructions include medication adherence, wound care practices (e.g., dressing changes), hydration guidelines, and physical activity recommendations (light exercise initially, gradually increasing as tolerated). Mr. Taylor was reminded to contact his healthcare team if he experiences any signs of complications or concerns.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial in managing Mr. Taylor's ongoing health issues. He will be closely monitored for changes in symptoms, laboratory tests, and imaging scans to ensure timely intervention if necessary.

Final Remarks:
	This report concludes with the attending physician's final remarks, acknowledging Mr. Taylor's resilience and cooperation throughout his treatment journey. The physician emphasized the importance of continued adherence to the follow-up plan for optimal outcomes. Both the physician and patient have signed the report on 01/01/2023.
