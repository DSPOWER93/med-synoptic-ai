Patient Information:
	•Name: Brian Maccormack
	•Date of Birth: 01/01/1965
	•Medical Record Number: M1136
	•Date of Admission: 01/10/2023
	•Date of Discharge: 01/25/2023
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Mack Collins
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer (Stage IIIB)

Reason for Admission:
	Mr. Maccormack was admitted to the hospital after presenting with severe abdominal pain and a change in bowel habits over the past two weeks. Upon initial assessment, he reported weight loss, fatigue, and weakness. Diagnostic investigations included a complete blood count (CBC), tumor marker tests, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, and colonoscopy, which confirmed the presence of a large tumor in his colon.

Medical History:
	Mr. Maccormack has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He underwent a left lower limb amputation due to complications from a motor vehicle accident in 2018. He has no known allergies but is currently taking metformin, lisinopril, insulin, albuterol, and ipratropium bromide for his pre-existing conditions.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology reports confirmed the presence of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the colon. The abdominal CT scan revealed a large tumor in the sigmoid colon with lymph node involvement and distant metastasis to the liver. Blood tests showed elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and anemia.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Maccormack, which included a right hemicololectomy with primary anastomosis followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Post-operative care involved monitoring for complications such as wound infection and anastomotic leakage. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil) every two weeks for a total of 12 cycles. Radiation therapy was not deemed necessary due to the extent of metastasis.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Maccormack's initial recovery from surgery was smooth, with proper management of his chronic conditions and the provision of adequate pain control. Challenges during his hospital stay included managing post-operative ileus and minimizing complications associated with his diabetes and COPD. Physical therapy played a crucial role in helping Mr. Maccormack regain strength and mobility after surgery. Nutritional support was provided to ensure adequate caloric intake and prevent further weight loss.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Post-discharge, Mr. Maccormack will undergo regular follow-up appointments with his oncologist and primary care physician. He will continue taking metformin, insulin, and albuterol/ipratropium bromide but adjustments may be made as necessary. Lifestyle modifications include quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy diet, and engaging in regular physical activity. Warning signs for recurrence or complications include persistent abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, unexplained weight loss, and symptoms of anemia.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Maccormack and his family were educated on post-surgical care, including wound care practices and signs of complications such as infection or leaks. They were instructed on managing the ileal conduit, including monitoring output and ensuring proper cleaning and hydration. They were also taught how to recognize common side effects from chemotherapy, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and strategies for managing these symptoms.

Discharge Instructions:
	Mr. Maccormack was provided with detailed discharge instructions to ensure his continued recovery and health maintenance. He was advised to strictly adhere to his medication regimen, maintain proper wound care practices, monitor his hydration status, and engage in gentle physical activity as tolerated.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is essential. Mr. Maccormack will require long-term management of his chronic conditions, particularly diabetes and COPD, to improve his overall health and quality of life.

Final Remarks:
	Dr. Collins concludes this report, praising Mr. Maccormack's resilience throughout the treatment journey and acknowledging his cooperation in following the recommended treatment plan. The physician emphasizes the importance of regular follow-up appointments and compliance with the post-discharge instructions to maximize chances of a positive outcome.
