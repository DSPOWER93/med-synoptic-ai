Patient Information:
	•Name: Earnest Collins
	•Date of Birth: 01/01/1970
	•Medical Record Number: M1327
	•Date of Admission: 08/05/2022
	•Date of Discharge: 15/06/2022
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Sheree Neace
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer (Stage III)

Reason for Admission:
	Earnest Collins, a 52-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital due to persistent lower abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits over the past six months. The initial assessment revealed a palpable mass in the lower abdomen and a positive fecal occult blood test. Subsequent imaging investigations, including computed tomography (CT) scans and colonoscopy, confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the sigmoid colon, invading adjacent tissues and lymph nodes.

Medical History:
	Mr. Collins has a history of hypertension and diabetes, both well-controlled with medications. He is a long-time smoker and was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) several years ago. He underwent a cholecystectomy in 2015 due to gallstones. His family history includes breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and colon cancer. He is not known to have any allergies and was taking metformin for diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, and albuterol for COPD before admission.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology report confirmed the presence of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the sigmoid colon. CT scans showed a large tumor (8 cm x 6 cm) invading the muscularis propria and involving adjacent lymph nodes. Blood tests revealed anemia, elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and lactate dehydrogenase levels.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Collins. He underwent a sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis, followed by abdominoperineal resection and creation of an ileal conduit. Post-operative care included antibiotics for infection prevention and pain management. A combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of FOLFOX (Folinic acid, Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin) was initiated to reduce the risk of recurrence. Radiation therapy was not deemed necessary based on the extent of the disease.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Collins's initial recovery from surgery was uneventful. However, he experienced post-operative ileus and required nasogastric suctioning for a few days. He received aggressive nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) during this period. His symptoms improved over time, and he gradually resumed oral intake. Regular monitoring of his CEA levels and CT scans were scheduled to assess the response to chemotherapy.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Post-discharge, Mr. Collins will undergo regular follow-up appointments with his oncologist for close monitoring. He will continue taking metformin, lisinopril, and albuterol, but the dosages may be adjusted based on his response to treatment. Strict adherence to a healthy diet is recommended, with emphasis on high fiber foods and regular exercise. Warning signs of recurrence or complications include unexplained weight loss, persistent abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, or fever.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Collins and his family were provided comprehensive education about the importance of post-surgical care, managing the ileal conduit, recognizing signs of complications, and managing common side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue. They were also instructed on how to monitor for recurrence and manage ongoing health issues.

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Collins was provided with detailed instructions regarding medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration, and physical activity guidelines. He was advised to monitor his vital signs daily, maintain a balanced diet, and avoid lifting heavy objects for at least six weeks.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	The prognosis for Mr. Collins is favorable given the aggressive treatment plan and good response to initial chemotherapy. Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence and managing ongoing health issues are crucial in maintaining his long-term health.

Final Remarks:
	Dr. Neace concluded the report, emphasizing Mr. Collins's resilience and cooperation throughout the treatment journey. She expressed her confidence in his recovery and underscored the importance of regular follow-up appointments and adherence to the prescribed care plan. Both Dr. Neace and Mr. Collins signed the report on 15/06/2022, validating its authenticity.
