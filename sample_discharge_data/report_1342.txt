Patient Information:
	•Name: Linda Carter
	•Date of Birth: 01/02/1970
	•Medical Record Number: M1342
	•Date of Admission: 03/15/2022
	•Date of Discharge: 05/10/2022
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Jessica Carter
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colon Cancer (Stage III)

Reason for Admission:
	Linda Carter was admitted to the hospital due to persistent abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, and changes in bowel habits over a period of two months. Upon admission, a thorough physical examination revealed abnormalities in his abdomen, prompting further diagnostic investigations. A CT scan confirmed the presence of a large mass in his colon, and biopsy results diagnosed Linda Carter (Linda Carter).

Medical History:
	Mr. Carter has a history of hypertension, which is managed with medication. He also has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II and COPD, for which he uses an inhaler regularly. His father passed away from colon cancer at the age of 60, and his mother died from breast cancer at the age of 52. Before admission, Mr. Carter was taking metformin for his diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, and salmeterol/fluticasone for COPD.

Diagnostic Findings:
	During his hospital stay, multiple diagnostic tests were conducted, including a CT scan, MRI, PET scan, and a colonoscopy. The pathology report from the biopsy showed invasive adenocarcinoma in the sigmoid colon. Blood tests revealed elevated CA-125 levels, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Carter. This included a surgical intervention to remove the tumor (sigmoid colectomy), followed by a permanent ileostomy (ileal conduit creation). Post-operative care involved monitoring his recovery, managing pain, and administering antibiotics to prevent infection. He also underwent six cycles of chemotherapy (FOLFOX) and five sessions of radiation therapy to the abdomen and pelvis.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Carter's initial recovery from surgery was challenging due to post-operative complications, including anastomotic leak and ileus. However, with close monitoring by the medical team, appropriate interventions were made, and he gradually improved. During his hospital stay, Mr. Carter received nutritional support, physical therapy, and psychological counseling.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Post-discharge, Mr. Carter will be following up with his oncologist every three months for the first year, then every six months thereafter. He will continue taking oral chemotherapy (Capecitabine) for a total of 12 additional months. Lifestyle recommendations include maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking and alcohol.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Carter was educated about post-surgical care, including wound care practices, managing the ileal conduit, recognizing signs of complications, and managing common side effects such as diarrhea and dehydration. He was also instructed on how to monitor his blood sugar levels due to the diabetes, and he received information about resources for emotional support during his recovery.

Discharge Instructions:
	Prior to discharge, Mr. Carter was provided with clear instructions regarding medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration, and physical activity guidelines. He was also given a detailed plan for managing his diabetes, including dietary recommendations and adjusting his medications as needed.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Mr. Carter's prognosis is favorable with regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence and effective management of ongoing health issues such as hypertension and diabetes.

Final Remarks:
	In closing, Dr. Jessica Carter commends Mr. Carter on his resilience and cooperation throughout the treatment journey. She emphasizes the importance of adhering to the follow-up plan and encourages him to maintain a positive attitude during recovery.
