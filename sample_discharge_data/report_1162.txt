Patient Information:
	•Name: Virgil Densmore
	•Date of Birth: 01/01/1975
	•Medical Record Number: M1162
	•Date of Admission: 03/05/2023
	•Date of Discharge: 05/10/2023
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Terry Abel
	•Primary Diagnosis: Advanced Stage Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder

Reason for Admission:
	Virgil Densmore, a 48-year-old male, was admitted to our hospital due to persistent hematuria and dysuria that had worsened over the past three months. Upon initial assessment, John appeared visibly uncomfortable, with decreased appetite and fatigue. A comprehensive examination was conducted, followed by a series of diagnostic investigations, including urinalysis, cystoscopy, and computed tomography urography (CTU), which confirmed the presence of an advanced stage Virgil Densmore of the Bladder.

Medical History:
	Virgil Densmore has a significant medical history that includes well-controlled hypertension, diagnosed in 2015, and managed with medications. He was also diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus in 2017. In addition, he has a family history of colorectal cancer (on his father's side) and lung cancer (on his mother's side). John had undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2012 due to gallbladder stones. He was taking metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin prior to admission.

Diagnostic Findings:
	The diagnostic tests conducted during John's hospital stay included urine cytology, CTU, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and biopsy of the bladder tumor. The pathology report revealed a high-grade urothelial carcinoma with lymphovascular invasion. The imaging studies showed a large, irregular mass in the bladder with evidence of local invasion and metastasis to regional lymph nodes and liver.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for John. This included radical cystectomy, followed by intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy for bladder preservation. Post-operative care involved managing complications such as urinary leakage and ileostomy care. John was also started on a systemic chemotherapy regimen consisting of gemcitabine and cisplatin, followed by radiation therapy to the liver metastasis.

Hospital Course:
	John underwent a successful radical cystectomy with ileal conduit creation. Post-operatively, he experienced complications such as urinary leakage, which were managed with additional surgical intervention and antibiotics. He also required intensive nutritional support due to his poor appetite and weight loss. His disease was monitored closely, and his responses to chemotherapy and radiation therapy were evaluated regularly.

Follow-Up Plan:
	John will be scheduled for outpatient appointments every three months for the first year, followed by six-monthly visits thereafter. He will continue on his current medications (metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, and pain medications) but may need to adjust his diabetes management plan due to changes in dietary habits post-surgery. Lifestyle modifications, such as quitting smoking and maintaining a healthy diet, are strongly encouraged. John was instructed to monitor for signs of complications related to his ileal conduit and common side effects from chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Patient Education:
	John and his family were provided with comprehensive education regarding his disease, treatment options, and post-surgical care. They were taught how to manage the ileal conduit, recognize signs of complications, and manage common side effects such as fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, John was provided with clear instructions for medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration, and physical activity guidelines. He was advised to follow a low-residue diet initially and gradually reintroduce normal foods as tolerated.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	The prognosis for patients with advanced stage Virgil Densmore of the Bladder can be challenging, but regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial. John will require lifelong surveillance to manage his ongoing health issues.

Final Remarks:
	This report documents Virgil Densmore's treatment journey for advanced stage Virgil Densmore of the Bladder. Dr. Terry Abel expresses her gratitude for John's resilience and cooperation throughout this challenging time. We are optimistic about his recovery and look forward to supporting him in his continued health maintenance.
