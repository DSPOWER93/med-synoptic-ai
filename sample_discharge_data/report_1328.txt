Patient Information:
	•Name: Shelley Graciano
	•Date of Birth: 01/01/1975
	•Medical Record Number: M1328
	•Date of Admission: 03/02/2023
	•Date of Discharge: 04/15/2023
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Cruz Mirza
	•Primary Diagnosis: Colorectal Cancer (Stage III) with metastasis to liver and lymph nodes

Reason for Admission:
	Shelley Graciano was admitted to the hospital due to persistent lower abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and unexplained weight loss. Initial physical examination revealed an abnormal mass in the lower abdomen and lab results indicated anemia. A CT scan confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the colon with metastases in the liver and lymph nodes, leading to the diagnosis of Shelley Graciano colorectal cancer.

Medical History:
	Mr. Graciano has a history of hypertension, which is under control with medication. He also has Type 2 diabetes mellitus, managed through diet and oral medications. He is a lifelong non-smoker but has a family history of colorectal cancer. His pre-admission medications included ACE inhibitors, metformin, and a statin.

Diagnostic Findings:
	The diagnostic workup confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the sigmoid colon with metastasis to the liver and lymph nodes. Pathology report from the biopsy indicated adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated. A CT scan showed multiple liver lesions consistent with metastatic disease. Blood tests revealed anemia, elevated CEA level, and electrolyte imbalances due to poor oral intake.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. Graciano. The plan included surgical resection of the primary tumor followed by a total proctocolectomy and ileal conduit formation. He received post-operative care to manage complications, and underwent six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFOX regimen. Radiation therapy was considered but deemed unnecessary based on imaging studies.

Hospital Course:
	Mr. Graciano's initial recovery from surgery was uneventful. However, he faced challenges with post-operative ileus and nutritional deficiencies. He received enteral nutrition support through a nasogastric tube, which was gradually discontinued as his bowel function improved. His diabetes and hypertension were carefully managed throughout the hospital stay.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Post-discharge, Mr. Graciano will be scheduled for regular follow-up appointments every three months for the first year, then every six months thereafter. He is to continue taking his diabetes and hypertension medications, and his ACE inhibitor dose may need adjustment based on kidney function tests. He was educated on recognizing signs of cancer recurrence and managing complications related to the ileal conduit.

Patient Education:
	Mr. Graciano and his family were provided detailed education about the treatment options, post-surgical care, and managing side effects such as diarrhea, dehydration, and low blood sugar. They were instructed on how to manage the ileal conduir, recognize signs of complications, and maintain a healthy diet to promote recovery.

Discharge Instructions:
	Upon discharge, Mr. Graciano was provided with clear instructions about medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration guidelines, and physical activity recommendations. He was advised to follow a low-residue diet initially and gradually transition to regular foods as tolerated.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	The prognosis for colorectal cancer patients with metastasis depends on the extent of disease, response to treatment, and patient's overall health status. Regular monitoring is essential for early detection of recurrence and managing ongoing health issues.

Final Remarks:
	We are pleased to report that Mr. Graciano has shown remarkable resilience throughout his treatment journey. His cooperation and commitment to the treatment plan have significantly contributed to his recovery. We wish him a speedy and complete recovery, and look forward to seeing him in his follow-up appointments.
