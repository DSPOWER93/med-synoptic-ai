Reason for Admission:
	Mia Driggers presented to the emergency department with a complaint of persistent lower abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. He reported a weight loss of approximately 15 pounds over the past three months. Upon initial assessment, his vital signs were stable but he exhibited signs of abdominal tenderness and distension. Given these symptoms, further diagnostic investigations were initiated.

Medical History:
	Mia Driggers has a significant medical history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He underwent a left knee replacement surgery two years ago. He also has a family history of colorectal cancer, as his father was diagnosed at the age of 65. Mia Driggers is allergic to penicillin and sulfa drugs. Prior to admission, he was taking metformin, lisinopril, amlodipine, albuterol inhaler, and ipratropium bromide inhaler.

Diagnostic Findings:
	The CBC showed a slight anemia (hemoglobin 10.5 g/dL) and an elevated white blood cell count (12,000 cells/mm3). The CEA level was markedly elevated at 10.7 ng/mL. The CT scan revealed a large tumor in the descending colon, with evidence of metastasis to several lymph nodes and the liver. Pathology reports from the colonoscopy biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma (Stage III).

Treatment Plan:
	Given the advanced stage of Mia Driggers's cancer, a comprehensive treatment plan was developed by a multidisciplinary team. The primary treatment was a left hemicolectomy with an ileo-transverse colostomy. Post-operative care included pain management, wound care, and nutritional support.

He was also given a list of warning signs that require immediate medical attention, such as fever, increased abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits.
