Patient Information:
	•Name: Leandra James
	•Date of Birth: 01/01/1970
	•Medical Record Number: M1271
	•Date of Admission: 03/15/2023
	•Date of Discharge: 04/20/2023
	•Attending Physician: Dr. Craig Miller
	•Primary Diagnosis: Pancreatic Cancer (Adenocarcinoma)

Reason for Admission:
	Leandra James was admitted to the hospital due to persistent abdominal pain, jaundice, and unintended weight loss over several months. Initial assessment revealed a distended abdomen with a palpable mass in the upper right quadrant. Diagnostic investigations including computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and laboratory tests confirmed the presence of a large pancreatic tumor with metastasis to nearby lymph nodes.

Medical History:
	Mr. James has a past medical history significant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has undergone a total knee replacement in the left knee ten years ago. His father died of lung cancer at age 65, and his mother had diabetes mellitus type 2. Allergic to penicillin, he was regularly taking metformin, lisinopril, insulin, albuterol, and tiotropium before admission.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology reports from the pancreatic tumor biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. CT scan showed a large (7cm) mass in the head of the pancreas, with involvement of nearby lymph nodes and metastasis to the liver. Elevated levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) supported the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Other relevant lab tests showed anemia, elevated bilirubin, and abnormal liver function tests.

Treatment Plan:
	The multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Mr. James, consisting of a Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Post-operative care included pain management, nutritional support, and management of potential complications such as anastomotic leaks or delayed gastric emptying. Radiation therapy was not deemed necessary in this case.

Hospital Course:
	The initial post-surgical recovery went smoothly, with Mr. James showing signs of improvement in pain management and nutritional status. However, he faced challenges related to anastomotic leaks and delayed gastric emptying, requiring close monitoring and adjustments to his diet and medications. Throughout the hospital stay, Mr. James demonstrated remarkable resilience and cooperation, actively participating in physical therapy sessions and adhering to his medication regimen.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Post-discharge, Mr. James will be scheduled for regular follow-up appointments with his oncologist every 3 months for the first year, then every 6 months thereafter. He will continue taking gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for adjuvant chemotherapy, while closely monitoring for side effects such as myelosuppression or gastrointestinal upset. Lifestyle recommendations include quitting smoking (if applicable) and maintaining a healthy diet low in fat and high in fiber.

Patient Education:
	Mr. James and his family were educated on the importance of post-surgical care, including proper ileal conduit management, recognizing signs of complications such as infection or blockage, and managing common side effects like diarrhea or nausea. They were also instructed on how to monitor for early detection of recurrence, emphasizing the importance of regular follow-ups with his healthcare team.

Discharge Instructions:
	Mr. James was discharged with clear instructions on medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration, and physical activity guidelines. He was advised to take his medications as prescribed, maintain a soft diet for several weeks, increase fluid intake, and gradually return to light activities as tolerated.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring for early detection of recurrence is crucial in managing ongoing health issues for pancreatic cancer survivors. Emphasizing the importance of adhering to the follow-up plan, lifestyle modifications, and reporting any concerning symptoms will help ensure the best possible long-term outcome for Mr. James.

Final Remarks:
	In closing, I would like to commend Mr. James on his incredible resilience and cooperation throughout this challenging treatment journey. His positive attitude and dedication to following the prescribed regimen have contributed significantly to his successful recovery. With continued support from his healthcare team and family, we are hopeful for a bright future ahead.
