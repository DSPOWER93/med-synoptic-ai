Reason for Admission:
	Upon admission, Yolanda Mcqueen presented with persistent abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, and a change in bowel habits over the past three months. Initial assessment revealed an abdominal mass and rectal bleeding upon digital examination. Subsequent diagnostic investigations included a CT scan, MRI, and colonoscopy which confirmed the presence of a large tumor in the descending colon and multiple liver metastases.

Medical History:

He underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2015 due to gallstones. His father died of colorectal cancer at the age of 65. John was allergic to penicillin and aspirin. Prior to admission, he was taking metformin for diabetes, lisinopril for hypertension, albuterol for COPD, and omeprazole for acid reflux.

Diagnostic Findings:
	Pathology reports confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon. CT scans revealed a large tumor in the descending colon with multiple liver metastases. MRI showed additional lesions in the lung and adrenal gland. Blood tests revealed anemia, elevated CA 19-9, and CEA levels.

Treatment Plan:
	A multidisciplinary team developed a comprehensive treatment plan for Yolanda Mcqueen. This included surgical resection of the primary tumor, followed by chemotherapy to eradicate residual disease and metastases. A right hemicolectomy was performed on September 20, 2022. Post-operative care included pain management, wound care, and nutritional support. Yolanda Mcqueen was started on a FOLFOX regimen of oxaliplatin, leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan for chemotherapy. Radiation therapy was deferred due to his overall health status.

Hospital Course:
	Yolanda Mcqueen's initial recovery from surgery was uneventful, but he developed a wound infection and sepsis on October 10, 2022. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics and supportive care. His blood sugar levels required close monitoring due to his diabetes, and his hypertension was managed with medication adjustments. He received chemotherapy in cycles every two weeks throughout his hospital stay.

Follow-Up Plan:
	Yolanda Mcqueen will be followed closely by an oncologist every three months for the first year, then every six months thereafter. He will continue to take lisinopril and metformin, but the dosages may be adjusted based on his response to treatment. A low-fiber diet and adequate hydration are advised to manage symptoms and prevent constipation.

Patient Education:
	Yolanda Mcqueen and his family were educated about the importance of regular follow-ups, early detection of recurrence, and managing ongoing health issues. They were instructed on post-surgical care, including managing the ileal conduit, recognizing signs of complications such as infection or obstruction, and managing common side effects like fatigue, neuropathy, and diarrhea.

Discharge Instructions:
	Discharge instructions included medication adherence, wound care practices, hydration guidelines, and physical activity recommendations. Yolanda Mcqueen was instructed to limit heavy lifting for six weeks and avoid strenuous activities until his wound has healed completely.

Prognosis and Long-Term Outlook:
	Regular monitoring is crucial for early detection of recurrence in colorectal cancer patients. Yolanda Mcqueen's prognosis depends on his response to chemotherapy, the presence of any residual disease or metastases, and his overall health status.

Final Remarks:
	This report documents Yolanda Mcqueen's journey with Stage III Colorectal Cancer and his successful treatment. His resilience and cooperation throughout this challenging time are commendable. We wish him a speedy recovery and continued good health.
