"I feel a bit drowsy & have a little blurred vision, so far no gastric problems.
 I've been on Arthrotec 50 for over 10 years on and off, only taking it when I needed it.
 Due to my arthritis getting progressively worse, to the point where I am in tears with the agony, gp's started me on 75 twice a day and I have to take it.
 every day for the next month to see how I get on, here goes.
 So far its been very good, pains almost gone, but I feel a bit weird, didn't have that when on 50."
"heartburn, nausea, frequent feelings of voracious hunger & sharp unbearable cramping pains in lower gut.
 Did not seem to make a lot of difference to the pain it was supposed to be treating.
 Stopped taking it after 13 days, prefer the pain in my forearms."
"Constipation right from the start and in ladt 4 weeks extreme joint pain at night (just few hours after taking tablets).
 Pain so bad it disrupted my sleep co pletely.
 also, extreme itching on legs and arms, so bad I scrathced myself raw.
 mobility has DECREASED rapidly, especially when trying to go down stairs.
 Was warned about possibility of constipation but think doctor underestimated how severe it would get.
 Arthrotec was supposed to ease my pain not make it worse.
 Have stopped taking and immediatedly muscle/joint pain eased and sleeping much better.
 Have reverted to use of co-codamol to ease symptoms as required."
"I am menstruating with heavy bleeding every 11 days.
 Honestly, I can't figure out how I can lose this much blood and still function.
 I have horrific cramps to begin with, so I can't say whether arthrotec increased that.
 I have endometriosis, so I'm not sure if that is something that doesn't agree with arthrotec.
 It did help with the pain I experience with the pinched nerve, but it is not worth it to me to continue."
"It began with stomach pain,then slight nausea, then reflux each time I took a pill.
 After the second pill the same progression of symptoms only now the abdominal gas,cramps and pain would be with me all day.
 I stopped pills but abdominal cramps persist.
 The only good thing I can say about Arthrotec is that I did notice pain relief but I won't put up with the side effects on a daily basis since I spent a long time getting rid of a reflux problem in the past.
 The abdominal gas,cramps and discomfort are another thing I don't want to see get worse if I keep taking Arthrotec.
 I've taken Tylenol 3 and never had a problem like this.
 Perhaps there is something not right yet with Arthrotec."
"started having a severe sudden onset headache in the back of head, resulted in trip to DR, BP was extrememly high, and pulse was high as well, after three shots, and 3 clonidine to bring down bp was recommend to visit ER.
 Had high BP for another 10 days, before it came back down to normal, and pulse is still extremely high 3 weeks after stopping the medicine.
 I only took for 7 days, and it caused this much problems.
 Never again, I would not recommend this to use.
 I have had 2 trips back to dr, since this happened and a third visit due to the tachycardia is schedule in 3 more days.
 I will not use anymore."
"No side effect to begin, but now starting to upset my stomach even while taking with food and plenty of water.
 Didn't work for me.
 Still can't sleep, can't work without pain.
 Didn't see any positive change."
"vomitting - I have to fight to not throw up I am supposed to take this twice a day - but it makes me soooooo sick that I take literally as I a going to bed, so that I am asleep before the sickness kicks in.
 I have tried and tried to take the day dose - but I would rather live without the sickness - its just too awful.
 very painful joints - but with this tablet, the pain is much much reduced.
 If I miss a couple of days I really know about it.
 If I could find the same sort of thing without the EXTREME nausea - I would switch drugs in teh blink of an eye."
"Hunger pangs.
 Brilliant, I have a new lease of life, i walk up & down steps properly, no longer sideways like a toddler, hip pain as gone other than if i jar it."
"NSAID gastritis, severe stomach upset after prolonged use.
 false full feeling, very poor appetite.
 increased menstruation, 2-3 periods a month instead of once a month, menstrual cramps present with or without vaginal bleeding.
 i would not recommend this medication for any female who has not already completed their menopausal phase."
"Initially, I experienced a slight, but noticeable difference in pain level: the pain was less severe.
 Within a few days, I noticed acid reflux shortly after taking, and it got progressively worse.
 It got to the point that I was apprehensive about going to bed; I consistently found myself waking up with acidic bile in my mouth, tasting like I had thrown up."
"Particularly diahrea!
 Many unscheduled washroom stops over the time I've taken this medication.
 Lately ankle swelling and lower tendon pain that was not experienced previously.
 Males tend to tolerate this medication better than women from my observation.
 This medication helped get me back to work and achieve tolerable pain levels and mobility.
 I stopped taking it for 4 days and the pain returned.
 Currently take one 75mg dose 2 hours before work and seems to be enough to ease my particular condition.
 Probably alright for otherwise healthy individuals but those with other medical problems should probably avoid it.
 It will most likely exacerbate there ill health with unwelcome side effects."
"I was prescribed this drug because I had spent a whole night in complete agony; abdominal pain, lower back pain, all that I imagine labor pain to be, except I was not in labor.
 Though the cause of my pain remains undetermined, the Arthrotec combined with Paracetamol pretty much eliminated the pain.
 This was a big relief, as the 1200 MG of Ibuprofen I had taken throughout the night had done nothing.
 I only took 1 Arthrotec and 1 Paracetamol and that did the trick.
 HOWEVER: I had a very bad headache yesterday and Ibuprofen again didn't work.
 I still had the other Arthrotec pills left, so I took one.
 Although it alleviated the pain, I got up this morning with heavy vaginal bleeding even though my period ended last week.
 I was relieved to read that this could be a side effect, as it means I probably don't have something serious, but I will have to be in some serious pain to risk bleeding from the vagina again.
 Next time I'll try my luck with Paracetamol.
 The pill I took consisted of 50 MG Diclofenac and 200 MG Misoprostol."
"just took the drug about 30 minutes ago and am now experiencing the worst abdominal pain ever, like mentstrual cramps/diarreah cramping combined.
 i had to keep dropping into a crouched position due to the severity of the lower abdominal pain.
 i was put on this medication because i was taking such high doses of Advil to quell the inflammation in my neck and back muscles that it caused me to have a GI bleed.
 but after this little episode, and after reading that it can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, i highly doubt this drug is the best fit for my problem!!
 i already have anemia due to the gastric bleed.
 how could my doctor not think of this?
 i'm also starting to feel dizzy and light headed, and can feel acidic bile at the back of my throat.
 great!!
 :|."
"slightly heavier menstrual cycle.
 An absolute miracle drug for me.
 None of the stomach issues others seem to have.
 I was at the point where I was becoming highly immobile and in constant pain.
 Started taking arthrotec and had IMMEDIATE relief.
 honestly never thought I would feel that way again.
 recently pain has started to increase though, and not sure if I've overworked my back.
 or if I'm becoming intolerant.
 Have recommended to two others who have had similar exceptional results for chronic arthritic type issues."
"1 month PRN.
 Horrible lower pelvic pain.
 Uterus contractions.
 Bloody vagina the next day.
 Horrible gastric pain.
 I am looking for another drug to replace this one.
 I went to the OB GYN thinking there was something wrong with my uterus but I am completely ok.
 I am not taking it again."
"I was experiencing lower back pain & noticed my spouse had some arthrotec 50mg anti inflammatory pills left.
 So i read about it online then decided to take one.
 Then about 20mins later i had MAJOR menstrual cramps & started bleeding.
 i had rlly bad sickness & ended up puking.
 .
 thank god i got the pill out my system, the pain stopped 10mins later but i am still menstrating.
 This drug cant be good for you if it brought my period on when ive only just finished my last cycle 10 dyas prior to taking the drug!
 I would not reccomend taking this drug if it hasnt been suggested by your physician.
 I wont be making that mistake again!."
"Didn't have much pain relief, and within a few days of starting the meds I began having cramps and heavy vaginal bleeding.
 My period ended last week and this med made me have another one!."
"Severe abdominal cramping, sweating, period cramps, vaginal bleeding, diarrhea, acid reflux, dry mouth.
 I would rather have had a migraine than the pain I suffered after taking one of these pills.
 Don't recommend at all."
"Within half hour of taking this drug I suffered from excessive cramping.
 lasted 1/2 hour and continued sporatically over course of several hours.
 Became tired,fatigue,shortness of breath from pain, dizzy,nausea, unconsolable.
 went hospital, but sat 5 hours never seen by doctor.
 drug wore off on its own and went home to rest.
 Threw away the remaining pills.
 Should be removed from market."
"I have taken 6 pills in the past (75mg each), but the side effect I had from my last pill was awful.
 It induced severe vaginal cramps without bleeding about 2 hours after I took the medication.
 I ended up having to take additional medication to get rid of the cramps (pamprin) so that I could sleep.
 Sat on the bathroom for 30 minutes.
 If I knew I would have went to bed with a sore knee instead - it hurt less than the cramps.
 This is the only anti-inflammatory drug that helps for my knee pain/inflammation and its reliable in that.
 I take it infrequently, once every several months and 1 pill is often enough for me."
"nausea,extreme hunger,stomach pain, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding,cramps.
 I really think that my doctor hates me.
 otherwise why would he give me this poison????
 after 4 days of suffering I'm stopping this nightmare and yes there was some improvement with the pain but is not worth to continue."
"After taking the drug for 7 years, i've suddenly developped diarrhea, nausea, loss of apetite, stomach cramps.
 I've had these symptoms for 4 weeks and i've just realised it could be side effects from arthotec.
 The problem is if i stop arthrotec I become paralysed by back pain.
 Seeing the doctor next week.
 But not sure if my symptoms are due to the drug as i've been on it for so long with no side effects.
 After trying several NSAIDs with side effects, I finally discovered arthrotec which relieved the pain and no side effects.
 I usually take 1 or 2 a day and when the pain gets really bad increase it to 3 a day for one or two weeks."
"One hour after taking Arthrotec, I experienced the sudden onset of severe mentrual cramps.
 I am on the birth control pill and should not have my period for another 3 weeks.
 I am in so much pain that I cannot sleep, nor can I take Advil for the pain as it is also an NSAID.
 The patient warning indicates that this drug can cause an abortion.
 I wish I'd read my entire monograph before taking the tablet.
 I would not recommend for women prior to menopause.
 Nor sure why my doctor thought it would help my endo pain."
"Anxiety and the feeling I was bleeding inside.
 Sudden feelings of cramp like being punched in the stomach.
 A general 'scared' feeling and sitting very still in the hope it would go away.
 I will tolerate the pain before I would ever take this again."
"vaginal bleeding and cramping 2 years after menopause.
 While this helped some with the joint pain, I was unpleasantly surprised at the return of my period after 2 years.
 I had severe endometriosis and adenomyosis all my life, plus the impairment in blood clotting due to EDS, so my doctor probably should not have prescribed this drug.
 I'm not taking any more tablets.
 Cymbalta 120 mg per day helps enough with the pain."
"I have been on Arthrotec for a year and a half and have been very pleased that it does help deal with my back pain.
 However.
 over the last six months, I have started having vaginal bleeding almost every day of the month.
 Lots of clotting, and horrible periods.
 I went to the obgyn and everything came out normal.
 The doc put me on birth control.
 But, the bleeding has not subsided.
 So now I am scheduled to have an endometrial biopsy on Wed.
 I had an ephiphany last night about Arthrotec and began researching the side effect.
 When I came across this website, I was appalled that the majority of the females mention heavy/extra vaginal bleeding.
 I firmly believe this is the answer to my bleeding problem and will be telling the doctor on Monday,.
 Although this drug has helped with the pain, it is not worth the cost and hassle of bleeding constantly.,
 On top of that, I am now having to have a procedure that a 31 year old should not have to endure.
 I truly hope that there are no long term effects from this.
 I have not taken Arthrotec in almost a week, yet I am still bleeding.
 I do not look forward to the extra pains I will llkely experience in a couple weeks, but I am sure I can find something else to deal with them.
 I feel that I have become dependent on this medicine to function."
"headaches, extreme tiredness, worse heartburn in back of throat, hunger pangs, dry mouth, severe lower abdominal pain/cramping, very irritable.
 Helped with pain BUT side effects outweigh benefits.
 No periods for 10 years, but felt like the worst PMS symptoms ever.
 This drug should not be taken by women unless misoprostol removed.
 As well, GERD much worse.
 Stopped taking & contacted doctor."
"the first pill i took it caused severe abdominal pain but after taking the first one it never did that again , but recently i've been feeling like my stomach is full and empty at the same time hard to explain but thats what it felt like , and also have been getting bruises allover my body due to this drug , other than that my back is back to normal now and i am back at work."
"just starting to feel tired this week after 3 weeks on the medication and that is the only bad side effect.
 I think I will try once a day.
 I could not walk or open my hands in the morning until I took this.
 I had a hysterectomy over 10 years ago, so it does not affect my period."
"Bleeding mini periods, lightheaded some time, finger tingling when I wake up."
"While this medicine did help with my pain, the side affects out-weigh the benefits.
 My menstrual cycle is completely out of whack, I'm bleeding several times a month.
 Nausea occurs when I'm hungry - very odd.
 Irregular cramping.
 This has been to date the only medicine to relieve my hip pain, but it's affecting my quality of life.
 Who wants to have their period all month long and be non-stop nauseous?!
 If they ever fix the kinks I'll be the first in line, but at this point I don't consider this a safe medication."
"Took my 1st pill 5 hours ago & almost immediately experienced sever abdominal cramps.
 Much like period cramps.
 Just took 2 Advil to try & combat the cramping pain!
 Also; some diarrhea.
 Will not take any more of these!."
"I took my first pill this morning, with food as noted.
 Rode my bike 12 minutes to work & didn't think I could make it.
 Got to work, ran to the bathroom with SEVERE abdominal cramping, had massive diarrhea & severe cramping continued for 2 hours.
 I had to leave work & go home sick.
 I would much rather put up with my debilitating chronic knee pain (waiting for surgery) than to ever take another pill.
 I spent $100 on the stupid pills - what an utter & complete waste of money."
"Upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation to loose bowels, excessive hot flashes and night sweats, blurred vision, irritability, chest discomfort.
 Took with food , did not help.
 Took for 7 and 1/2 days.
 could not take another dose.
 Very bad drug.
 Would rather have the elbow pain!."
"Dizziness, sickness, stomach gas, feel like a bubble of air is stuck in my chest.
 Hadn't realised it was related until I read this but I get the hunger pangs too, I'm assuming this is the acids and gas in your stomach constantly churning over that make you feel like you're hungry.
 I've taken co-codamol for my fibromyalgia for many years which I have very few side effects with.
 I've recently had this severe hip pain on both sides which the co codamol wasn't touching so I went back to the Dr He recommended this anti-inflamatory and as he said next stop would be cortozone injections I was willing to give it a try.
 I've tried it for a week but it makes me feel dreadful.
 Every time I stand up I have to hold onto something for fear of falling over, I feel sick and light headed and I get those waves of nausea where you suddenly feel all clammy.
 It's very much like having a permanent hangover, even down to the hunger which until I read thsi site I hadn't connected to the rest of it.
 I've felt no discernible difference in the pain in my hips and the side effects simply aren't worth it so thats it for me and this drug."
"Stomach pains, chest pains, anxiety, fatigue, headache, erratic heart beat, raised blood pressure, dizziness, nausea (even when taken with food), blurred vision.
 I was given a 6 day trial of Arthrotec along with a 9 day trial of Aciphex on 4/25 (three bottles of three pills).
 This was a solution my doctor came up with.
 I've never had consistant heart burn or indigestion, no signs of acid reflux, so I was confused as to why he would offer me this medication.
 The first day I took both pills, I experienced some dizziness and some nausea and some serious period like cramps.
 I was at work, so I just had to brush it off.
 It continued each time I took it.
 After about two days (two doses), the cramps continued and began inhibiting my menstrual cycle (which I was due to start).
 So, I googled the side effects of the drug, came across this site, and realized I wasn't the only one with those side effects, so I felt a little better about it.
 On the evening of 4/30, I suddenly got some serious chest pains, an elevated heart rate (I was laying down with my husband and this was similar to an ""I just finished running!"" heart rate), hot flashes, dizziness, sever stomach cramps, and weakness in my legs.
 I literally thought I was dying.
 It passed within 45 minutes and I was able to go to work the next day.
 At work (5/1), I was sitting at my desk and the same thing happened.
 I stepped out to get some air but it didn't work.
 A friend at work had to call an ambulance.
 I was filled in by the ER doc that the mixture of Aciphex and Arthrotec was insane and that he was trying to keep from cracking up at my primary doc's decision to combine them."
"Random severe cramping, diarrhea, increased menstrual blood flow.
 The day I took my first Arthrotec, I started experiencing urinary incontinence.
 It's not severe but enough to be disruptive and require a pad.
 I haven't seen this listed in anyone's symptomology.
 Has anyone else had this experience?."
"This medicine helped with the heel spurs, however the side effects were far worse and not worth taking the medicine.
 I had bad gas and SEVERE diarrhea along with stomach cramps and nausea."
"Has been all OK until recently when I started to get "" fluey"" feelings in upper arms, legs etc
 As I had just recently had flu jab thought this was the cause.
 However the symptoms persisted, GP said "" just flu jab"" - but after 4 weeks!
 Noticed today after leaving Artrotec off for a day or so ,that things were much better until I took one dose.
 fluey feelings returned within a hour.
 Draw your own conclusions."
"Naseua, vomiting, cramps, dry eyes, loss of appetite."
"after taking just one dose, had hunger feeling and stomach cramping, in the eve and through the night constant muscle cramps in my calf muscles, couldn't sleep, had to keep jumping out of bed because of the cramps.
 I just went for test and haven't gotten results yet, but Dr feels I have more than 1 form of arthritis, I also have a very sensitive stomach, this is cheaper and more approved by health insurance, so that is why this prescribed.
 Seems to me we always have to choose lesser of the 2 evils, I can't deal with Charlie Horses, so I am stopping this med."
"Took one pill and 20 minutes later had intense pelvic and back pain.
 Felt like a miscarriage (I've had 3 of them).
 This intense, horrid pain lasted 1.5 hours.
 Then I had spotting.
 And terrible bloating and nausea."
"no side effects.
 Met with surgon last week to schedule hip replacement.
 Could not tolerate pain.
 Was on hydrocodine heavy aand did not like side effects.
 Almost overnight was 100% pain free.
 Sorry ladies i don not have bleeding or stomach pains.
 Truly wish you could have same results as i have.
 Took 5 years ago for shoulder pain and it worked as well.
 I am on my feet all day requiring steps and was ready to retire.
 I danced at a wedding this weekend for the first time in 3 years."
severe nausea dizziness terrible stomach pain.
"Went to hospital for my Tmj pain because it was getting out of control.
 A doctor prescribed me this to take two a day.
 One pill and 20 minutes later the worse period cramps in my life.
 After half an hour it passed, but its been a day a half now, and i still feel sick after eating and random shooting lower abdominal pains.
 I'm scared to death."
"From day one of taking this pill I have experienced a significant reduction of pain in both areas and no stiffness in my hands, where before had very little mobility in my right hand, I have however experienced extreme pain/heavy bleeding and dizziness during my period which is not normal for me."
"Took away all my hip pain.
 Had very bad cramps diarrhea and heavy bleeding even thought my period wasn't due for 3 more weeks
 been off this pill for two days now and still feeling same
 hoping cramps stop soon can't stand feeling sick all day."
"I have spotting and it had started 2 days after I was taking them
 I had stopped taking them for 3 weeks now and still have spotting problems, I talked to doctors and they just shrugged it off.
 And then told me go home, I still want to have more children I am at my wits end!!!."
"Disorentatation,trouble brathing, extreme hot, redness and swelling, itching, later abominal cramps.
 All this came all sudden in couple of minutes.
 I had been taking arthrotec before for my knee pain and it helped me a lot.
 I only had 10-12 pills left from last March when I had a cortisone shot and my knee pain went away."
"I have vaginal bleeding, my cycle was back (I'm menopausal ), breast pain
 Other symptoms I have: erithema, my skin is so dry I have little cuts on my hands, I 'm sweating a lot (usually I don't), pruritus ani etc
 I took it 3 times: the first for 3 days, then I stopped because it didn't make great improvements and I had diarrhea.
 My doctor told me the symptoms had to go away after taking few more Second time: I took other 3 pills in 3 days.
 little improvement with the pain.
 I had the first vaginal bleeding, a lot of pruritus and my skin was all red but I didn't know it was arthrotec/
 My doctor prescribed me a topical cream , did some a vaginal test to exclude infections.
 I had my cycle The last one for 4 days.
 More problems and this time I had the ideo to go on Internet and I discovered I had a lot of the side effects by taking Arthrotec
 Why they don't tell you about them?."
"Took 1 pill with dinner, woke during the night with stomach pain.
 In the morning I discovered that I had bled heavily during the night.
 Bleeding continued the next day with clotting.
 Also developed a rash on my wrist.
 Discontinued use after one pill!!.
 After checking the web site and seeing the list of side effects for this medication, it is hard to believe that it was ever approved.
 I do not recommend this medication for anyone.
 I have never had a reaction to any medication before.
 The complications of this drug outweight the benefits."
"Very little side effects,some gas.
 Gave me my life back.
 Now I can sleep at night and do most activities.
 Mobility without pain!.
 Worry about the long term side effects of an NSAid drug."
"none with light stomich ake sometimes.
 a little shortness of breath at times.
 this product changed the way i have lived for 5 years.
 i had a back operation 20 years ago and my time of mobility was going from bad to worse.
 absolutly changed my life.
 i can go all day.
 there is one thing that i need to look into.
 my mother in law has rematoid arthro.
 she walked into the emergancy room and is hooked up to a machine to keep her alive for now .
 one week.
 she had an alergic reaction to the medicine she had been taken for her arthritice.
 she had been taken it for two years.
 and i do not know what to do.
 she has an infection in her lungs and lost all capassity.
 but the only thing i know is that it was not arthrotec,but can it all be the same?."
"I have vaginal bleeding, my cycle was back (I'm menopausal ), breast pain, Other symptoms I have: erithema, my skin is so dry I have little cuts on my hands, I 'm sweating a lot (usually I don't), pruritus ani etc

"i have experienced extreme stomach pain when taken on an empty stomach, and moderate stomach pain when taken with food.
 i also had some drowsiness after taking arthrotec.
 arthrotec works very well for my knee pain, more so than mobic or celebrex.
 however, i do experience stomach pain from time to time."
"Severe, gut-renching abdominal pain, jaundins, diahrea, sweats & hot flashes, vaginal bleeding, and now constipation.
 I had to go to the emergency room of local hospital and that's where I learned of the side effects.
 From the info on the web about this medication, it should not be given to anyone.
 I can't believe it was approved at all."
"very minor--slight nausea when taken on empty stomach--which was gone in 15 minutes.
 gave me my life back.
 concerned about long term effects."
"W/ prescribed dosage (75 mg BID) crankiness and irritability.
 Increased BP.
 Possible visual disturbances.
 Relieved pain very well.
 However, the side effects are a great concern."
"For the first 8 days of ever taking it, the only side effect was a similar feeling you get when you have an empty stomach and light nausea that lasted for no more that 30 minutes
 After 8 days, the feeling elevated to an annoying sharp pain in my stomach.
 Then two days later, I had to stop using it because the pain was becoming unbearable.
 Now I have been off for two days and I still have the stomach pain.
 Aside from the stomach pain, it worked miracle on my nighttime spinal pain.
 Now I have to see my doctor again to see if I should keep taking it.
 I tried Naprosyn just before and had to stop taking it for the same reasons."
"Some gas & diarrhea but overall OK if taken with food.
 Tried other anti-inflammatories but this is the one that works best for me.
 Helps me walk & carry on a normal lifestyle because it eases the pain a lot."
"severe acid reflux after taking for 15 days.
 I am back on it now for 1 month after making adjustment to my diet.
 Helps very much.
 I would get about a 30 sec.
 headache but no longer.
 AS I have had a history of running to the toilet I dont do that any longer.
 Happy response.
 Since I cant take most of the other meds.
 I was hoping this one would do the job.
 It is helping more than I could have wished for.
 If you email me, make sure you put the subject in or I wont answer."
"Within 5 minutes of taking drug, developed severe colon and uterine cramping.
 Cold sweat, fainting, heart palpitations.
 Will never use again or recommend."
"more frequent menstral periods (twice a month).
 Works but can realy tell how good it works when I had to go off of it."
"I've been post-menopausal for five years and have now had a six day period with all the accompanying tender breasts, bloating, cramping etc
 I had only been taking on an ""as needed"" basis so one or two a day approx.
 every 3 to 4 weeks."
"Slight Gasto discomfort, but usually take NEXIUM so discomfort is tolerable.
 I take ARTHROTEC 50 every day, sometimes BID and have found nothing that works better.
 Now I am running out, am un-insured and can't afford the medication.
 Will probably go back to IB 800 mg BID."
"Vaginal bleeding when it was not time for my period, headaches, neck pain,bloating and weight gain.
 It helped relieve the pain in my lower back but I would not recommend this to be used by women of any age.
 Not quite sure what I will do now because I cannot take Bextra or Neurontin.
 I guess go back to plain old advil and deal with it unless the doctor has another medication I can try."
"swelling, bloating, increased appetite, empty stomach feeling,dry,itchy skin.
 Arthrotec works wonders, but side effects worry me.
 Am trying to wean off it with glucoasamine/chondroitin and MSM, which are supposed to be good for arthritis, bone enhancement/elasticity etc
 Taking all at same time now,pain is too great!
 Was on IB 1600 a day and 2 tylenol 8's a day.
 not enough."
"Blurred vision, Stomach ache, Water retention, Throbbing headache.
 Elevated my blood glucose levels because I am also on Vasotec, Glyburide, Avandia.
 Beware of this drug."
"Very very severe abdonimal pain, next day my stool was black which could indicate blood in my stool, going to doctor today.
 I will never take it again."
"abdominal pain, constant soreness in abdomen, headache, general stomach upset feeling that won't go away before or after eating.
 

 I was taking Celebrex until ineffective, then Vioxx, then Lodine, and now Arthrotec.
 I realize that a knee replacement is inevitable, and I need the medication, but the stomach pains are aggravating although bearable."
"frequent heartburn.
 take it once a day and it works very well on the pain."
"I had diarrhea, severe abdominal pain which was constant for 4 hours straight, vomiting, trembling, dizziness, nausea.
 Arthrotec seemed to induce my menstrual cramps and cause the pain to be severe.
 I would not recommend this drug to anyone, especially since I have never had such an adverse reaction to any other medication.
 Also, I would caution women not to take this medication while menstruating, since one side effect can be severe menstual pain."
"I developed severe abdominal pains, severe welts all over my legs from feet up to knees, swelling of throat, rapid heart beat and headaches."
"Horrible stuff.
 how did this ever pass scrutiny of the powers that be.
 Crazy side effects.
 Dizziness while rolling over while sleeping and faintness and disorientation upon sitting up in the morning.
 Major stomach pain, massive gas cramps and bloating.
 Could not stop going to the bathroom with the runs.
 Thought I was having a heart attack or stroke coming on.
 Only took it for 5 days with only one a day in the morning with food.
 Could not figure out why I was so sick.
 Thanks to this site.
 Stopping it pronto!
 Needs to be banned.
 Warnings should be discussed with pharmacist face to face when this is prescribed and before taking it.
 Should be scrutinized from the first pill."
"This medicine completely relieves my thumb pain, and really helps with my back pain.
 BUT, it makes my stomach hurt soooo bad that I'm not sure what is worse.
 I only use it when my thumbs hurt so bad I want to cry.
 Then I put up with the stomach pain.
 It also give you diarrhea but I can handle that."
"Abdominal cramps, flatulence, gas, bloating.
 Cramps would start within 15 minutes of taking pill, even during meals.
 Reduced coccyx pain but the cramps and bloating were very uncomfortable."
"My urine is bloody, I have got canker sores the size of golf balls, my face is falling off.
 It hurts.
 My arm feels better.
 But my face.
 its falling off."
"The day after I started taking it, I had a little vaginal bleeding in spite of being menopausal for 10 years.
 I had been using Estrace for several months but had not had bleeding from the Estrace alone.
 My back does feel better, not 100% OK, but probably 60%."
"The pill eliminated all pain I felt in my hip, but it was hard on my stomach.
 On my 10th day of medication, I experienced vaginal bleeding.
 This scared me because it was two weeks after my normal period.
 There is something really fishy about this drug.
 I do not advise anyone to take it as there are many adverse side effects."
"Heavy, extended bleeding during menstruation.
 works good on back pain."
"Extremely heavy menstral cycles, fatigue, slow healing & clotting.
 If I miss a day, headaches begin to creep in.
 Tried many others, this seemed to work best for quite some time.
 No day is pain free, though.
 Not bad on stomach - always take w/ milk or food.
 This is genetic for me, so NSAIDs will be in my life for a while.
 but fear long-term use of this one."
"Experienced excruciating, unusual abdominal pain (bowel, uterine) and lower back pain for about 5 hours after taking (including diarrhea 6 times), and heart palpitations and vaginal bleeding for about a day after taking.
 I took with 2 aspirin (which I've since learned is contraindicated) and some fruit.
 This may be the reason for problems in my case.
 I will not take it again as the pain was extreme, but others should be cautious to take with lots of food and no aspirin."
"Terrible first of all I had diarrhoea my doseage was increased to 75 and a few days ago my feet and ankles started swelling up.
 I went to my GP and the results of my blood test showed there was something wrong with my liver and I am a non-drinker.
 My blood pressure had gone sky high so my that is why the swelling.
 I was told to stop taking Arthrotec and am now using a natural product that seems to work it is called Pernamax."
"For the first week I took one pill at bedtime, but then switched to mornings with breakfast.
 I experienced extreme uterine cramping within 30 minutes of taking in the morning; I was in excruciating pain for an hour so I called an ambulance and was rushed to the emergency room.
 Heavy bleeding started within 30 minutes after the cramping ceased.
 Medical personnel dismissed the symptoms as not being related to taking this drug, but once I stopped taking, my cramping and bleeding stopped.
 Subsequent uterine & vaginal ultrasounds did not show anything else to be the cause.
 My OB/Gyn told me that she uses misoprostal (1 of the drugs in Arthrotec) for miscarriages & advised me to stop taking the drug.
 I would not recommend to females.
 If you do take this drug, please pay careful attention to your body and other symptoms that may appear.
 Read all drug material carefully."
"The symptoms got progressively worse with time.
 They included fluid retention, all over muscle pain, cramps.
 I stopped taking them a week ago and felt much better the next day.
 Some of the side effects haven't totally disappeared but I'm improving with each day.
 My doctor doesn't believe that this medication could cause this reaction."
"If I take the pill on an empty stomach I get a very faint sensation of queasiness .
 almost to faint to notice.
 However, I also get diarrhoea at least twice a day.
 There are no gas pains and no other symptoms, so it's inconvenient more than anything else.
 When I am on holiday at the coast I am pain free, mostly, so don't take any Arthrotec, but when I get back to a drier climate the pain is severe, so Arthrotec is very important to me and my quality of life.
 It also allows me to sleep."
"no side effects for the first two months .
 then vaginal bleeding 2 wks after menstral cycle.
 stomach pain.
 canker sores in my mouth.
 headache.
 been off for 1 week still have bleeding.
 helped my pain alot .
 too scared to take this drug again."
"1st pill taken with food, a few hours after i experienced shortness of breath, a sense of depression, cramping, upset stomache will stop taking immediately.
 Honestly can not recommend this drug, I am still experiencing side effects just after 1 pill and im supposed to take twice/day 75mg.
 I just cant keep going have to try something else."
"It seems as if bleeding forever is a side effect but doctors tell you that its not the drug
 I have been on Arthotec for Three months I still have pain and stiffness
 at first week into this drug I was in so much pain I sat on the floor at work and thought I was gaving a baby.
 I always feel weak and almost fainted a bunch of times.
 Consider somthing that works I am switching today as this isnt in my head."
"some diarrhea, some constipation, fatigue.
 it works very well for the heel; I couldn't walk on it very well before taking it.
 I take 75mg.twice a day.
 Also have severe osteoarthritis in the knees and hands, but it doesn't seem to relieve that pain at all."
"I've been on 75mg twice daily for 13 days, with recent body swelling, face, wrists, abdomen, thighs - clothes fit tight.
 Insomina is much worse.
 I have forgetfulnes and confussion - really bad - almost dangerous.
 Have felt ""empty stomach"" feeling, but not bothersome.
 Have had more loose stools, but tolerable.
 I'm looking for a more natural therapy, checking into HA (Hyaluronic Acid) to replace Arthrotec."
"Hospitalization due extreme rectal bleed that required blood transfusion.
 I was extremely sick and initially felt I might not survive.
 Should be removed from market."
"Abdominal pain, Dizzieness and blood clots in urine which caused problems with urine leaking.
 I stopped the Arthrotec twice and restarted but the same symptoms came back.
 I will not take this medication again."
"Upset stomach and the feeling that I may need to throw up.
 The pain in my stomach is in the middle of my stomach above my belly button and its a deep constant pain.
 I also feel like I may need to go to the restroom, but when I do I can't.
 MISERABLE!!."
"I had diarrhea for a whole week;bad uterine cramps followed by heavy menstrual bleeding two weeks after my period.
 Alot of gas and nausea.
 This pill stopped my pain, but cause me more pain.
 The side effects are much worst than the pain itself."
"This greatly improved the swelling when I had a surgery on both legs.
 There weren't any side effects.
 maybe a little gas but may not be related to the drug.
 I would recommend this to anyone that has swelling of any sort to help heal an injury.
 The doctor did say to only take it 5 days though because it reduces mucus in the stomach and it can cause extreme stomach pain if taken too long."
"I can't describe the horrible stomach pain, constipation, uterine, cramps and pain in the ovaries (menopausal for 20 years) pressure in the stomach, couldn't urinate for a whole day, severe stomach pain, constant burping.
 The experience was a certain kind of hell!.
 This drug is a bad trip!."
"Within 15 minutes started to have stomach cramping, almost like period cramps.
 I was on the toilet for a good 30 minutes in extreme pain.
 My uterus starting to have spasms which was the worst pain I have ever experienced, I got some nausea from the pain, I had to go to bed in a ball and just lie there until the pain subsided which felt like an eternity.
 Then when the pain subsided I begin to have some bleeding and I was on day 12 of my cycle.
 I would rather die than take this drug again.
 Although It works wonders for my back pain, it is not worth it to go through the uterus pain and cramping.
 I am going to try and find a sister drug to arthrotec.
 Its weird because I have been taking this drug off and on for about 4 months and this only has happened to me 3 times, but I have no way of knowing when it will randomly happen and it is not worth it to take that risk.
 I have began to think it has something to do with the day of my cycle affecting how bad the pains will be."
"Stomach cramps, gassy most of the day.
 Cannot take it on an empty stomach!.
 I can finally clean my house without pain.
 I am feeling so much better, I can sleep all night and rise in the morning without pain."
"Swelling & weight increase.
 No relief in pain.
 My doctor advise that I stop using."
"uncontrollable Diarrhea,kidney function.
 This product is the best medicine for arthritis pain I have ever taken, however after taking it for approx. 10 years it started affecting my kidneys, my stomach(acid reflux) and the diarrhea got worse, short term, I had no problems,this would be a great product if the manufacturer could get rid of the side effects."
"appetite increase, stomach feels empty all the time.
 pain feels better, but the appetite increase worries me."
"Headache, dizziness.
 I took 1 tablet today, and won't take another one.
 I looked up the side-effects because of a headache and am scared to death by what I read."
"After taking my first pill, I quickly experienced extreme uterine cramping.
 It felt like I was having a baby and broke out in a cold sweat, shaking uncontrollably, nauseated, several bowel movements.
 I felt like I was going to pass out, which would have been welcommed after feeling what I felt.
 The pain subsided fortunately within 15 minutes, but now this morning I have vaginal bleeding and I am only 11 days into my cycle.
 Do not recommend unless you are prepared to deal with gut wrenching pain and going into shock.
 Not worth it, I will continue to take Ibuprofen instead."
"dizzines dioreah stomach cramps disorientation.
 followed by ulceration of the osophragus,and stomach, and possibly the gut.
 Prone to infections especially of the blader.
 have been taken off the drug, stayed on it too long because it allowed me to work.
 Talked myself out of the side effects, until they frightened me.
 Now I dont know how I am going to get back to work, it has left me feeling exausted, and depressed."
"i was prescribed arthrotec 75 to take twice a day with or before food.
 i took the very first tablet as directed,two hours later i was doubled up in pain with stomach cramps, i had very bad diarrhoa,and heavy menstral bleeding with clots even though i had just finished my cycle a week before.
 to add to this i couldnt pass urine,when i eventualy did it was full of blood.
 i also felt very weak and could not stop shaking.
 I spoke with my doctor just hours after taking this medication,i described all my symptoms,the bleeding was dismissed as being a coincedence and nothing to do with the medication!!
 I can say that is total rubbish.
 I would avoid this medication at all costs."
"I had extreme abdominal pain that came on almost instantly and lasted hours from taking the arthrotec for the first time.
 I also experienced some bleeding and threw up a number of times.
 I urge people to think twice about taking this drug.
 I will not be taking it again."
"took 4 out of 5 days.
 Stomach cramps, gas, constipation, headaches, and, maybe a coincidence, the muscles in my left leg locked up.
 Also, up 5-6 times at night to pee; normally 1 or 2.
 Stopped taking this drug.
 The side effects more than cancel out the possible benefits.
 Not fun."
"stomack pains, vomited all night about 6 times, abdominal pain, then i got severe vaginal bleeding , horrible.
 do not take it."
"Lower dose for first month produced sporadic intense stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea.
 Always prided myself on having a cast iron stomach until this script came along.
 I have to rate it a 5 for knee pain so I lived with it.
 Then my doctor increased the dose after one month and I have never had anything work so well on reducing osteoarthritis pain.
 Unfortunately, I have also never been so sick from a prescription.
 Increased dosage produced constant, unyielding stomach gas and intense pain, gastrointestinal cramping, diarrhea and pain pain pain.
 If your gastrointestinal system can handle it, its an amazingly effective arthritis drug.
 however I welcomed the knee pain back after suffering the side effects and booked an appointment with a knee surgeon!.
 Was so sick after 2 days at the increased dose, I decided it just was not worth it."
"Feels like menstrual cramps, back ache, sick to stomach for 24 hours +.
 Was unhappy about being prescribed this but gave it a try since the pharmacy couldn't take it back (mistake -- didn't read about it until after I'd picked up the prescription).
 After taking pill with food, feels like menstrual cramps, lower back pain & nausea within 45 minutes.
 After the last pill, have been sick to my stomach for over 24 hours.
 Discontinuing use immediately.
 Have heard great things about Celebrex.
 Maybe will ask for that."
"I experienced mild cramps and bloating.
 It helped to relieve the pain."
"Some swelling of the legs.
 I had been unable to get relief from my pain for 2 months following a bone marrow biopsy.
 I was up to 30 arthritis strength tylenol and numerous Tylenol 3 daily.
 Couldn't sleep because of the pain.
 No concentration.
 Loosing days of work.
 Within 2 days of taking the arthrotec 50 (twice daily), the pain was gone.
 Even the arthritic pain I had in the knees and an ankle.
 gone.
 I can sleep again.
 It is great to be able to sleep & function again."
"From one pill : Heavy menstrual bleeding even though my periods ended a week before, cramps, nausea.
 Women, beware: do NOT take this medicine unless you've taken it in the past and it was right for you.
 Also, do NOT take this if you might be pregnant!
 I checked the reviews on this website before taking this drug, and I thought ""oh, I'm sure it won't happen to me"".
 Sure enough, 2 hours after taking a single pill, the bleeding and cramps started.
 Never again will I touch this drug."
"Ongoing stomach problems, had to have an endoscopy to understand why so much pain.
 Stopped the drug, got better, but pain in foot meant I had to try again.
 I was advised to take Arthrotec with Zantac when necessary, as it would counter the affect on the stomach.
 2 weeks later after very small doses there is blood in my stools, major cramps and I have to have a colonoscopy.
 awful awful awful.
 I will to have to live with the foot pain because I simply cannot go through this again.
 I would strongly recommend never going near this drug."
"Stomach queasy, but very mild, and goes away.
 Just started taking this med after Celebrex 200mg, and before, Meloxicam, other NSAIDs,and natural supplements.
 Putting off hip & back surgery for life long OA.
 Seems to be working fine, pain is limited, though I still limp with damage in hip.
 Spine & hip pain is greatly reduced!
 Menopausal, so waiting to see if minor period bleeding starts like it did with Celebrex.
 I'm on no dairy, non-gluten, natural anti-inflammatory diet, no refined sugar.
 RA runs in my family, so this is lifelong commitment & it works.
 Limited caffeine.
 This drug works so far, and is giving me back my life.
 No irregular bowel or issues so far, and I'm low risk factor for liver, B/P, & cardiac issue.
 I take with a meal, use Tums if necessary.
 Good so far."
"Fatigue, Constipation followed by diahorea.
 Eventually started passing blood and clots with stoals.
 Painful stomach cramps.
 I would not take this drug again, side affects caused me anxiety until I read reviews here of people with similar side affects."
"severe headaches, stomach pain, loose stool, all of which spontaneously ended, followed soon after by agonizing muscle spasms in leg with bad knee.
 Now beginning to experience spasms in left arm.
 immediate relief from full body athritic pain, great relief from knee pain--relief from knee pain gradually diminished, probably because I became more active."
"Ate a decent meal and took one pill at 4:30 pm, the 75 size, on 9/10.
 Within 15-20 minutes my stomach felt empty and hollow.
 Within 1 hour I had stomach pain that felt like deep pain- like gas pains.
 I kept eating a small amount of food to make the stomach emptiness and pain ease up.
 Went to bed and felt hot flashes and sweated (I don't sweat, am cold natured) and had pain in the pit of my stomach all night.
 I felt a deep ache from my waist down to the heels of my feet (Like ""back labor"" pains during childbirth, for those of you who have experienced such a thing, or a prolonged miscarriage.)
 My stomach stayed upset and painful through 9/14.
 On 9/15 my stomach quit hurting, but the deep pain in my pelvis and down my legs (it felt like my leg bones were filled with cold metal and ached deeply and hurt!)continued through 9/16.
 I was just tapering off of my menstrual period when I took the one pill, but noticed an increase in cramping and breasts getting more and more (and more!.
 The side effects were harder to deal with than the condition I was taking it for- and it made me feel 200% worse!
 Not worth it!
 I will carefully take ibuprofen or Aleve (naproxen sodium)- limit using it as much as I am able- and deal with ulcers if I ever end up with one!
 Taking this horrid stuff to prevent one just is not worth it!
 Pharmacist finds it hard to believe one pill did all this- but looked at other meds, and no other explaination.
 I took last Lyrica, after a two week trial, on 9/15.
 FYI:(I reacted about the same way (excessive mestrual bleeding) to oral, low-dose Prednisone, as well.)
 I seem to be more hormonally/chemically sensitive than a lot of people.
 It may not be important, but it MAY be> I cannot take, whether because of over-reaction, adverse reaction, allergy: Birth control pills or shots, Codeine, any opiate-based, hydrocodone, prednisone, corti-cortisones, pseudoephedrine, morphine, demerol, percocette, darvon, cyclobenzoprene, (sulfur drugs listed as possibly lethal due to parent's reaction.)
 Allergic to citrus fruits & bioflavenoids, lanolin/wool, and topical Benedryl."
"The only side effect that I experienced was the hungry feeling in my stomach ;however I have no complaints, just praise !
 Deborah McCready."
"None that I noticed.
 I did take my blood pressure today though, and it was slightly elevated from the norm.
 I suspect the drug is responsible, but as I am only taking it short-term, I am not overly concerned.
 I had acute shoulder tendonitis and was in absolute agony.
 Within 24 hours of taking this medicine, the inflammation was reduced dramatically and I have continued to improve, gaining back more of my range of motion with each day."
"I took the drug only once, at about 9:00 p.m.
 15 minutes later I experienced dizziness, nausea, and stomach pain, followed about 10 minutes later by level 6 pain in major joints (knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, hands).
 Elevated blood pressure and heart palpitations.
 Still felt somewhat dizzy and sick the next day.
 Extreme gas in stomach and intestines for several days afterward.
 Had acid reflux-type symptoms for a few days, though I have never had reflux.
 Evil drug!!."
"Some stomach irritation, feels a bit like my pressure is up (in my head mostly).
 I pulled my lower back at the gym 2 times.
 last time was about 1 1/2 years ago and it was pretty bad.
 Since then my back has really gotten worse.
 I still exercise everyday and stretch, but it really is not helping.
 I final went to the doctor and i am getting x-rays on my spine tomorrow.
 He gave me about 25 samples of Arthrotec 75.
 3 days later I cannot believe how good my back feels.
 It has to be this drub, because this is the first day i can comfortably bend down with no pain and even touch my toes without bending my knees.
 It seems that this drug, like many drugs, works for some and not for all.
 as for me seems to be really good."
"Took 50 mg arthrotec with one tylenol #3 and within 30 minutes I had the most severe abdominal pain I've ever experienced.
 It was more like bowel/uterine cramping.
 It was so severe I had to go to the emergency room.
 I had spent the day there already for my shoulder pain, was given a prescription and never told of these side effects.
 I then spent the night back in the ER for the severe pain.
 The doctor thought it was likely the codeine in the tylenol #3 but after reading all these comments, I doubt it very much.
 Will never take this medication again."
"Severe abdominal pain,bloating,gas,nauseous,constant hunger.
 These symptoms persisted three days after I stopped taking the drug.
 My stomach is still sore when palpitated after 5 days.
 Please think twice before taking this drug."
"Once I had bad nausea due to taking it on an empty stomach.
 Also causes bleeding problems.
 Stops migraine immediately when taken early on when all others didn't.
 If I wait I have to take two doses.
 Easy to take - a powder in a small amount of water.
 It is an anti-inflammatory, not a hypnotic.
 My insurance only pays for 4 doses a month, less than I need, and paying for it without insurance is too expensive."
"Tastes gross -- heavy mint flavor.
 Felt like it was burning my esophagus all the way down, then dry heaves once it hit my stomach.
 But it didn't make me actually vomit, and the burning sensation went away quickly.
 Was prescribed Cambia as a backup to Maxalt, since triptans can be taken only 2 days/week.
 Unfortunately, it didn't work at all on my migraines, so I'll continue to look for something else as a backup."
"Because of aspartame component I experienced worse migraines.
 If aspartame is a trigger for your migraines, do NOT take this.
 Most doctors will say it is such a small amount that it will not matter.
 It does!."
"rectal bleeding, collapse.
 Emergency admission to the hospital.
 I would never recommend this drug to anyone.
 It is not worth the chance of GI hemmorage which is what I experienced."
"Dry mouth.
 Go buy candy.
 It's cheaper and have the same effect on pain.
 I take it with 2 propain (40 mg each) at a time, or 2 mypaid forte (Ibuprofen 400 mg Paracetamol 325 mg each) (Don't do this!!!) and it don't work for more than an hour."
"Stomach pains, gass, dry mouth and drowsiness.
 Wonder if arm rest wouldn't have delivered same result without the need to take drug."
"Side effects are some drowsiness and some dry mouth.
 Can take it on an empty stomach with no problem.
 The drowsiness is nice and helps me sleep, as well.
 Overall an excellent drug that works better than any other NSAID I've tried!.
 I was surprised to find that this drug noticeably lowers my pain level after about 45 minutes.
 I still have to take it in combo with a stronger pain reliever, but it's just a good drug for aches and pains.
 Better than things like Vioxx and OTC stuff, for sure."
Cataflam Linked to Stevens Johnson Syndrome.
"Lower gut pain, diahrrea.
 This is the only NSAID I've ever taken that gave me discernable relief within 90 minutes of taking it.
 Gastrointestinal problems were due largely to my taking the drug too close together, or after having consumed large amounts of alcohol."
"Absolutely none!.
 I was originally taking 150mg per day, but cut it to 100mg because the lesser dose seemed to work as well.
 My internist had urged me to take Vioxx, Celebrx and Bextra (at different times, of course), but the relief I experienced was not as dramatic as the Cataflam.
 My orthopaedic surgeon prescribes the Cataflam.
 It has a slight effect on my blood pressure, but, since my pressure is usually low, that is not considered a health risk."
was given this to replace ibuprofen (possible sun sensitivity developed with ibu) but it doesn't relieve any pain for me or reduce inflammation.
"None, unless too much is taken too close together, then it can cause gassy abdominal cramping.
 It is the BEST pain reliever I have ever been prescribed and I will never do without it!
 I happen to have Endometriosis that has attached to ""everything"" in the backside, including my Sciatic nerve.
 Sciatic Endo is rarely seen, but they found it in me.
 I do Restorative Yoga postures to get myself loosened up every day, but keep the Cataflam handy as nothing works better for the pain, unless I have an extremely bad time where I have to take a Demerol with it (rarely).
 However, I have noticed in the ""patient info"" they give with my Rx that now warnings of NSAID's causing heart attacks and strokes are written where they were not before when I started this Rx.
 The best dose for me (per my doctor) is 2 pills to get in your system, then 1 every 8 hours afterward.
 Luckily, I only need this a few days a week at the most, here & there.
 I highly recommend this especially for lower lumbar arthritis and to women for dysmennorhea.
 it will do the trick!."
"rectal bleeding/collitis.
 No symptoms of GI distress BEFORE Cataflam but 4 days on it and I ended up in the ER and hospitilized.
 My drs dismissed Cataflam as the reason yet my discharge papers have NSAIDS"" listed under patient allergies.?."
"Well after 3 days of use I consulted doctor with throat pain.
 Make a very long story short.
 After 3 days of use it gave me 3 esofogual uclers.
 Also couldn't eat or drink for over a week which isn't pretty.
 It's 3 months later and I still can't eat normal.
 I'm always sick."
"Very drowsy and tired and no pain relief at all.
 Unlike previously taking just one tablet of Aleve, which immediately took away my pain symptoms, this drug had absolutely no effect at all.
 My doctor prescribed this drug (instead of Aleve), to be taken twice daily, but after reading the side effects, I am concerned about that frequency.
 I'll not bother with it anymore and will occasionally take Aleve instead.
 Fortunately my pharmacy made an error in only giving me 6 tablets instead of 60.
 I'm glad it happened; it saved me an unnecessary expense."
"HEADACHE, BUT MOSTLY SWELLING OF THE LEGS AND FEET.
 HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.
 BLADDER INFECTION .
 I STOPPED TAKING ONCE I REALIZED THE SWELLING I WAS HAVING WAS DUE TO THIS MED.
 HAD A VERY BAD BLADDER INFECTION AND FOUND OUT IT CAN CAUSE THE BLADDER NOT TO EMPTY AS IT SHOULD.
 IT DID NOT HELP WITH MY PAIN AS WELL AS ALEVE DOES.
 I WISH I HAD READ THE SIDE EFFECTS OF IT BEFORE TAKING IT.
 SOME OF THEM REALLY SCARED ME ONCE I DID READ THEM."
"I have vaginal bleeding and my vaginal skin burns a lot, my cycle was back (I'm menopausal ), breast pain Other symptoms I have: erithema, my skin is so dry I have little cuts on my hands, I 'm sweating a lot (usually I don't), pruritus ani etc
 I took it 3 times: the first for 3 days, then I stopped because it didn't make great improvements and I had diarrhea.
 My doctor told me the symptoms had to go away after taking few more Second time: I took other 3 pills in 3 days.
 little improvement with the pain.
 I had the first vaginal bleeding, a lot of pruritus and my skin was all red but I didn't know it was arthrotec.
 My doctor prescribed me a topical cream , did some vaginal test to exclude infections.
 I had my cycle The last one for 4 days.
 More problems and this time I had the idea to go on Internet and I discovered I had a lot of the side effects by taking Arthrotec."
"no stomach pains - no excessive drowsiness but slept well- I took medicine during dinner on a full stomach.
 My left foot was hurting badly enough that I couldn't walk without hobbling.
 Several hours after taking medicine most of the pain disappeared, and I am back to normal.
 Great success, I'd say!."
"No side effects so far, but have only been on it for a month.
 Has taken away 20% of my chronic pain and trigger point pain on a good day and about 5 to 10% on a bad day.
 No drowsiness, grogginess or memory loss like I had with Neurontin."
"Slight stomach upset became worse and resulted in a perforated ulcer which nearly killed me!
 I will never be perfectly well again!
 My gastrc surgeon put the blame firmly on this drug.
 I was fit, 48 and ate an excellent diet.
 It did help my arthritis, but in my opinion the possibility of side effects was not taken very seriously.
 It can kill you: post operatively I suffered bleeding, peritonitis, septicaemia,renal and respiratory failure.
 I was sent home wearing 2 stoma bags and 3 wound dressings, weighing four stone!(56 lbs)."
"Muscle pain, leg cramps, fatigue, irritable, pain in feet, neuropathy.
 I have stopped this medication a couple of times and my doctor keeps insisting I take it, rather then alternative medications.
 I'm getting off of this stuff after reading so many people are having similiar side-effects.
 Doctors need this information!."
"Sudden onset of extreme weakness and fatigue.
 I got up one morning and could barely walk across the room.
 I stopped taking the drug and the symptoms disappeared."
"I started taking Lipitor in December 2009 and stopped after 4 months.
 During this time I experienced extreme pain in both shoulders, sometimes in the neck also, causing me to wake several times each night.
 Pain was worse in the morning but rarely went away completely during the day.
 Most mornings it was impossible to wash my hair in the shower as I was unable to reach the top of my head with my hands.
 Pain and restricted movement often prevented me from putting on shoes and socks without assistance.
 In January this year I started experiencing discomfort in my left hand for the first time.
 Now in both hands, the pain has increased, fingers are swollen and movement is restricted.
 My wife tells me my hands are warm to touch.
 The mornings are worse when they hurt the most, movement is restricted and it is impossible to make a fist.
 Ice and ibruprofen gel help but only for a short while.
 I have been taking 400 mg Ibruprofen 3 times daily for a couple of weeks on my doctors advice without.
 This drug is clearly POISON to so many people and perhaps there is good reason to take Pfizer to the courts.
 However I do believe that any Doctor prescribing Lipitor should make it abundantly clear to the patient that very serious consequences could ensue that would cause extreme pain and could effect quality of life.
 I believe that failure to do so is a serious deriliction of duty that should be tested with complaints to the medical authorities that oversee our doctors and/or the courts."
"At the beginning I did not had any side effects, until a few months after start taking Lipitor I experienced pain in the lower legs, sometimes I could not even walk in the mornings my muscles were very stiff.
 After consulting with my doctor he told me to stop taking Lipitor until the pain went away and to start taking it after the pain was gone.
 I followed the doctor's order.
 After a few more months of taking Lipitor I began to develop severe pain in the muscles in the shoulder area, upper back and neck, the pain and stiffness of my neck was so bad that sometimes I couldn't even turn my head when I was driving.
 I went to my doctor and she thought it was stress.
 I took off work for a month and during this time I tried to relax and the pain did not go away.
 I decided to be off Lipitor on my own and within a couple of weeks, the pain and stiffness from the neck and pain in the shoulder and back is going away, I feel much better now that I am not taking Lipitor.
 I do not think I will take Lipitor ever again, the problems that have been causing me are too much to risk my health again.
 I will look for alternatives ways of reducing my collesterol."
"I am a physician.
 I have been on simvastatin, pravastatin, and now atorvastatin.
 My joint pains are severe and I have developed a dys-motility, irritable bowel syndrome of the sigmoid area and descending colon with obstipation and constipation that is very bothersome.
 Cannot take statins and I agree with most other comments of patients on fatigue and joint pain and short term memory dysfunction."
"Back, hip thigh, knee pain, which is affecting my gait.
 Memory loss.
 I almost forgot(did I say memory loss?).
 fatigue.
 As the dose increases the pain has worsened.
 I have been on Lipitor for probably 10 yrs.
 Have tried nearly all statins with similar side effects.
 10 mg no real side effects, no real benefits either; 40 mgs- fatigue, muscle aches but able to tolerate it though not happy and still no appreciable change in cholesterol.
 now on 80 mg and feeling extremely uncomfortable.
 Why am I on 80 mg?
 because the insurance company required a trial at this high level, before I can switch to an alternative and reduce the dose back to 40 mg.
 Since when did the insurance company go to med school so they can dictate what I should be on.
 sorry for the rant."
"Cramps in my feet, pain in the lower part of my knees, fatigue, mental fog.
 During the three years that I was taking Lipitor, my cholesterol averaged as follows (n = 5) all units mg/dL: Total Cholesterol - 140 HDL - 38 LDL - 74 Triglycerides - 139 Total/HDL Ratio - 3.67
 After stopping Lipitor and all other statins in 2010: Total Cholesterol - 218 HDL - 34 LDL - 184 Triglycerides - 167 Total/HDL ratio - 6.4
 After switching to 10 mg Simvistatin: Total Cholesterol - 136 HDL - 38 LDL - 70 Triglycerides - 138 Total/HDL ratio - 3.58
 I take 1/2 of a 20 mg generic Simvistatin pill daily.
 Very little side effects, cheaper, and does the same job as Lipitor."
"In last 6 month, calf of left leg began to burn Nothing will stop it.
 Now, severe cramping.
 Also have tinnitis, headaches, cannot get to sleep on my own,
 Just had surgery on my knee for torn maniscus, waiting to have shoulder surgery on rotator cuff, arthritis.
 I do not know if its the LIPITOR that is doing it.
 My doctor only increased my dosage to 60 from 40 about 3 months ago.
 can we quit this med cold turkey?
 I have had a Myocardial Infarction in '98, have 2 stents implants, and need the med to keep my chol at least within reason, although obviously its NOT doing its job, or med would not have been increased."
"I started taking Lipitor in Dec 2009.
 Experienced some leg muscle discomfort, but went away within a few weeks.
 In June, I ran out of my prescription, was busy, forgetful, stupid and didn't request a refill until about 2 weeks later.
 It took another week to get the prescription because I had switched doctors and the pharmacy didn't follow up.
 Anyway, after 3 weeks or so of not taking Lipitor, I started it again.
 Now a week later, I feel like I've been run over by a truck.
 I started having extreme muscle discomfort, achiness, cramps.
 I assumed it was due to my half-marathon training.
 I ran five miles last Saturday and expected to be sore for a day.
 But it has continued and gotten worse each day.
 I also started have muscle aches in my neck and shoulders and lower back.
 I couldn't figure out why.
 I also have felt extremely fatigued and people are telling me I look really tired and asking if I'm ok.
 I feel like I'm in a fog and it's a chore to just walk around.
 Last night right."
"Body aches, joint pain, decreased mobility, decreased testosterone and libido, difficulty getting out of bed in the morning, tingling and itchy hands,and decrease in overall strength.
 I have been taking lipitor for many years.
 I started out on 10mgs and now I am on 40mgs.
 I have had hip replacement, back surgery, and shoulder surgery while on this drug.
 I have seen my strength decrease dramatically.
 I have to be on testosterone replacement.
 My brother is also on Lipitor and has had recent knee surgery for a torn miniscus and ACL.
 He is also on testosterone therapy.
 Im only 47 and he is 45.
 This sounds like alot of physical problems for guys our age.
 It wasnt until he mentioned that he had heard about the possible dangers that statins have on tendons that I saw all of these other people and their problems with Lipitor.
 This could be the reason for many things that I have been suffering physically.
 I am getting off the Lipitor immediately for a few months to see if some of my symptoms get better.
 Fish oil, niacin, vitimin c, and a healthy diet!!!."
"While taking 10 mg I have experienced no adverse side effects.
 It was only when increased to 20mg/day that I experienced increased bone and muscle pain.
 I have been taking Lipitor 10mg per day since 1997 with no adverse effects.
 The only problem I experienced was when one Dr increased my dose to 20mg per day to lower LDL to prevent another infarction.
 I have never had real high cholesterol, 218 at tops and now am around 158 total, triglycerides are also excellent.
 I have found that when using substitutes for this drug, I experience adverse effects, so I only take the name brand now.
 Good drug if you are started with a low dose right off the bat.
 Many Docs want to start you at 20mg or above, too much for the body to take, I think."
"Soon after starting Lipitor I developed extreme pain in both inner arms at the elbows, over the next years I developed inflammed ligaments and bursae in my shoulders and ankles.
 Also Nerve pain in shoulders, ankles and feet.
 Finally extreme burning of shoulders and ankles.
 I was started on Liptor 20 mg 7 years ago.
 It was increased to 40 mg.
 3 years ago.
 The pain increased proportionately to the time I was on the drug and the dose increase.
 Neither my doctors nor I ever related these pains to Lipitor.
 I stopped Lipitor six months ago as an experiment.
 Within 3 weeks I had recovered about 50%.
 I hve not recovered past this point.
 I still can't walk without extreme pain.
 I have to wear ankle supports, night splints, ice compresses frequently, gel pads, elevated heels.
 My shoulders are doing better than my ankles and feet, but they still hurt.
 My GP and the surgeon who says I now need surgery on both ankles for the inflammed bursae are reluctant to connect my pain and disability.
 My GP still wants me on statins.
 She is annoyed that I will not take any.
 I am taking Red Yeast Rice with COQ10 now instead of a statin along with 2000 mg of Vitamin C daily.
 Basically Lipitor has ruined my formerly active life.
 No more dancing, golf, hiking, even standing too long sets my ankles on fire.
 I will have my cholesterol rechecked in September to see if the Red Yeast Rice helps my elevated cholesterol.
 I was never warned that any of the symptoms I have experienced were in any way related to Lipitor."
"I have not clinically proved my theory yet , but I strongly believe that taking Lipitor for 4 years ended up giving me Multiple Sclerosis.
 I am a 37 yr old male, I was diagnosed with MS two months ago.
 My cholesterol was it's highest at 212 when my GP prescribed the drug.
 My total cholesterol while on it got down to 130 ish.
 This is too low in my opinion and my body began attacking my CNS and now have to live with this.
 Again, this has not yet proven, nor have i gone down that road yet.
 

 Big Pharma wants to promote the use of statins to treat MS, when I stopped taking mine (Jan 2010)that is when my symptoms became present??
 I may have been the human rat in that theory.
 To make matters even worse, the therapy my neurologist wants to put me on, just so happens to be the same company that mfg.'s Lipitor.
 hmmm!."
"Neuronal Apoptosis (Brain Cell Death) as evidenced on MRI scan, and confirmed by brain biopsy with electron microscopy, Mitochondrial DNA mutations, similar to that of MELAS, Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like episodes.
 Evidenced by Brain Biopsy w/ Electron Microscopy, as well as Serial Lactic Acid levels consitently well above normal range, as well as a Muscle Biopsy studied under Electron Microscopy.
 I was 34 years old when I was hospitalized for nearly 1 month, leaving me permanently and totally disabled.
 I was a critical care Registered Nurse for the prior 12 years.
 I loved my job and have only 1 regret, that I ever educated people on the dangers of High Cholesterol, and convinced them to take these poisons.
 Cholesterol has very little to do with heart disease, and ALL statins are toxic.
 See www.spacedoc.net A site by a former family physician/NASA flight surgeon, disabled by his use of Lipitor.
 If you want more proof, email me ////// I have a ton of it.
 I want to educate people as to the REAL cause of heart disease."
"Severe shoulder and upper body pain including tendonitis.
 Was in PT for 7 months.
 No relief from any pain pills.
 Ice gave some relief.
 Fatigued and worse pain by end of day.
 Worse when changed to Pravachol- this made all joints, muscles and tendons hurt all over my body- that's how I learned it was the statins causing my problem- doctor still doesn't believe me.
 It doesn't instantly improve with stopping the meds either, even though doctors may say it will after 1 month.
 It takes at least 3+ months for the drug to get out of your system according to pharmacists- but you still may have pain that continues after that.
 I recommend the website spacedoc.net for lots of info, reccommended supplements, and help on this.
 Recently discovered that completely avoiding all caffeine and alchohol and just drinking water durring the day helps the pain, fatigue and weakness diminish significantly.
 Also, warm showers help as does walking (if your legs don't hurt)."
"Pain in all my muscles and joints and bottom of feet.
 Has continued for 3 years to date.
 NEVER, NEVER NEVER use it or any other statin.I will check back in and document how I feel in a month."
"First the doc thought I had gastritis from pain in my abdomen, headaches, flushing - I had an abdominal ultrasound, endoscopy, then CT scans (2) and then yesterday an MRI - all were normal.
 The fatigue, muscle pain, headaches, and general malaise continue.
 I am taking myself off this drug and hope that my apparently healthy body recovers.
 Why is my doctor unaware of the Lipitor side effects?
 Why did I spend almost $1,000 of my own money AFTER insurance on all these tests without considering that my symptoms match those for Lipitor?
 So frustrating!
 I will check back in and document how I feel in a month.I'll check back here for the results."
"abdominal cramping, gas.
 My cholestrol was lowered from 267 to 175.
 I went from 20mg to 10 mg and it is still low."
"Severe back pain, flank pain, hematuria, kidney failure.
 This was the worst drugs I could ever have taken and could not possibly recommend that anyone take it.
 Lipitor caused permanent liver and kidney damage to me and is a killer."
"severe muscle pain in hips, legs and ankles.
 It helps lower my cholesterol, but recks my muscles severly.
 I take a 6week break and resume dosage of lipitor."
"Lipitor did help lower my cholestrol, but has caused other health problems not listed in the side effects.
 I have had digestion problems since I have started taking this, my pancreas is very swollen.
 I have been through every test possible, and they cannot find anything wrong with me.
 I have lost 35 lbs, and have recently just heard that this has happened to other lipitor patients.
 I stopped taking it, and feel better already!.
 Please email me if you have had similiar problems."
"Extreme fatigue and general weak feeling overall like I have never experienced EVER in my entire life before.
 In all honestly, I feel as though my sense of well being has taken a sudden decline after taking this medication for only two weeks.
 I intend to phone my M.D.
 this morning about discontinuing this medication."
"I have headache, muscle ache, diarrhea, indigestion, abdominal pain, back pain, eyesight has changed sinus problems, joint pain, leg cramps.
 I have fibromyalgia also and my pain should be at a lower level instead of worse.
 I am stopping this on my own tomorrow!
 My doctor never even suggested diet first!."
"At about the same time as I started taking lipitor I began experiencing chest muscle soreness and spazms which have persisted.
 I now take neurontin, an anti-seizure drug together with pain killers to deal with the muscle problems.
 I have had three blood tests over time which indicate that the lipitor is not damaging the muscles.
 I remain suspicious that lipitor is contributing to my muscle problems (physiotherpist say there is other causes) but there is no denying that my cholesterol levels have been improved (they never were that bad)."
"MUSCLE PAIN IN LEFT ARM WEAK FEELING GENERAL MALAISE.
 I WOULD NOT RECOMMENDTHIS DRUG."
"HORRIBLE JOINT PAIN IN ALL MAJOR JOINTS, INCLUDING PROGRESSING TO ALMOST UNBEARABLE MUSCLE PAIN IN ALL MUSCLES IN BOTH UPPER AND LOWER EXTREMITIES, HAIR FALLING OUT, PRESCRIBED DARVACET FOR THE PAIN AND WAS ALMOST DIAGNOSED WITH FIBROMYALGIA, SIMILAR SYMPTOMS.
 MY MOTHER HAS HAD THE SAME SYMPTOMS, ALSO WAS ON LIPITOR AND WAS RECENTLY TAKEN OFF BY HER NURSE PRACTITONER.
 IF YOU ARE TAKING THIS MEDICATION CLOSELY WATCH FOR JOINT OR MUSCLE PAIN AND IMMEDIATELY SEE YOUR PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN FOR A DIAGNOSIS IF YOU WANT RELIEF.
 I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS MEDICATION FOR THE LOWERING OF CHOLESTEROL."
"after taking for about 1 yr, I noticed muscle pain and weakness in both arms on and off.
 I ache 24 hrs a day.
 This is now continous for about 6 weeks.
 I called MD today, he said stop taking lipitor immediately and sent me to lab for blood tests to determine if any damage done to liver, muscles or heart.
 I wish I had called MD sooner.
 Hope if any damage, it is reversible."
"went to hospital with what i throught was heart attact.
 dr. could fine nothing wrong.
 head aches.
 muscels hurts, week.
 sick at stomach, tired all the time.
 if this is the cause why do Drs. recomemend it.
 i will not take it anymore."
"Over the past three years the drug has definately worked but I have developed almost a dibilitating problem with both of my arms.
 I am unable to move them in any direction but the normal motion.
 It has got to the point where turning over in bed wakes me up because of the pain it causes.
 I have had a blood test to determine if Lipior is causing this serious problem and the results said no it wasn't.
 However, I even went to an orthopdetic surgeon and after he checked me out, he looked at the drugs that I take (i am also a type 2 diabetic) and he said ahh, Lipitor.
 more people taking this drug come to me with problems like this .
 I have an annual physical on 8/27 and am going to tell the doctor I'm stopping the Lipitor to see what happens."
"I have been taking Lipitor for 4 years and was part of the original study.
 And ever sinse then I have headache, muscle ache, diarrhea, indigestion, abdominal pain, back pain, eyesight has changed sinus problems, joint pain, leg cramps.
 every joint in my body is in pain some times the muscle and joints in my angles hurt so much I cant walk in four years time I have gone from an active agile person to an artritic old woman I have to take codine/4 every night just so I can go to sleep.
 I quit taking this medication 3 months ago and still have not gotten any better.
 In the four years Ive been taking this medication noone has every told me about this side effect.
 I even went to the doctor and told him of all the pain and he said it could be arthrites.
 ."
"The drug worked well to lower my cholestorol from 8.5 to <3.
 Of late I have ben getting pain on the sole of my feet and find it dificult to stand or walk for too long.
 Hands are also tender and tingle, Often forgetful and tired to point of lacking energy to exercise.
 Lack libido.
 I also feel hot and am more sensitive to sunlight.
 After reading similar comments, I am off to see my doctor to change medication."
"Mild muscle pain and burning.
 My symptoms grew dramatically worse after adding Tricor 145mg on advice of physician.
 Took Lipitor for about 8 years to reduce cholesterol from 240 to 160.
 On advice of physician added Tricor 145mg to reduce trigycerides from 330.
 Combination was very effective - cholesterol to 140, triglycerides to 150.
 Side effects increased noticeably a few months after starting tricor.
 About 4 months after starting tricor, spent a day of heavy physical exertion (shoveling snow).
 Immediately afterward side effects increased dramatically, severe muscle pain, burning, cramps, exhaustion, mild nausea, inability to concentrate.
 After two weeks of decline, contacted physician, who directed me to stop both medications.
 One week after cessation and I am starting to feel a little better.
 Belatedly reading on the web about this combination (I was never informed that physical exertion can bring on these side effects) I recommend extreme caution with this combination."
"muscle pain, fatigue, swollen tongue.
 Was on Simvastatin for 1 year with slight decrease in ratio, then Inergy with increasing skin itchiness after 8 weeks, then Lipitor for 24 days."
"stiff upper leg, quad area.
 some chest pain left side.
 not for me.
 called my pharma said usualy these side effects in 1-2 weeks."
"pain all over my body.
 aches and overall misery."
"It either caused or gave me peripheral neuropathy in my hands, arms, feet and legs.
 And it damaged my liver.
 No one should ever take a statin.
 It should be taken off the market."
"Cannot be sure it is the drug, but around the time I was on it a month, began having pain on outer sides of thighs.
 Knowing some cholesterol meds can cause leg pain my doc did some kind of check on me and said it was not the drug.
 Still have those pains, not terrible, just feel like I have been hiking uphill and am fatigued there.
 Has done a very good job keeping cholesterol down.
 I am going to request lowering the dose w/ the doc."
"Indigestion, intense heart pain, sore muscles, anxious, restless, lack of sleep.
 Has anyone had severe chest pain?
 I have loss the will to do anything.
 no sleep, emotional, just plain want to give up."
"Stopped because of HIGH CPK.
 My Liver blood test are also mildly elevated.
 I was in deniel that the statins would cause ME side effects- I have Terrible muscle and joint pain, Burning sensations in neck shoulders and upper chest.
 Palpatations .
 Insomnia because can not sleep from pain.
 I do not want to take pain killers all the time since they have side effects too.
 Weight gain -probably not associated.
 IOne of the reasons I left my job is because I was so weak all the time and had difficulty walking and driving.
 I was a Sales rep for a drug company and many years ago I promoted Zocor.
 How IRONIC that I should suffer from statins my self.
 My life is miserable.
 I feel like dying.
 I am sorry I did not keep my weight low so as to avoid my lipids to go so high.
 That way I would have never had to suffer like I am now.
 The doctors just say and my husband OH your in pain because you are over weight.
 The doctors also did not even follow me up properly.
 WHo can I sue??????
 That is the question."
"Mild muscle pain.
 Tried Crestor and generic Zocor and couldn't tolerate the side effects.
 Started Lipitor and after 6 weeks my blood work showed great improvement.
 Total was 251-now 156.
 LDL was 176-now 91.
 HDL is now 51.
 Triglycerides were 96-now 69.
 Very glad I gave Lipitor a try."
"Had muscle pain in my back (primarily small of my back) and down my leg.
 I had tried Lipitor before and the result was achy legs.
 After some time off of this drug and feeling better, I tried it again.
 My back hurt so bad that I went to a chiropractor twice and no relief.
 I thought I might have a bulging disc but decided to go off the Lipitor again.
 After two months, I'm back to normal.
 I call this the drug from hell."
"developed parkinson's disease.
 discovered thru 23andme DNA profiling I possess a mutation in a gene, SLCO1B1, that codes a transport protein responsible for moving statins into the liver to be detoxified.
 Studies have noted patients with greatly incrased plasma statin levels (>134% and AUCs more than 400% ABOVE NORMAL) toxic levels indeed.
 The neurological damage I have suffered due to toxic levels of lipitor seems to be permanent.
 Nothing I have tried has reversed the extreme symptoms.
 in the beginning megadoses of coenzyme Q10 did help; that was 6 yrs ago.
 the deterioration continues.
 the slco1b1 mutation IS NOT rare, occurring in 26-34% of caucasian poulation, less in african am, and more in Asian pop.
 seems many individuals with the mutation(s) develop severe myalgias and myopathies, prompting discontinuance of the statin.
 for those of us who did not suffer the muscle dmaage, neurodegeneration is what occurs in my opinion.
 Am aware of 7 other indicviduals who feel they are sufferring same effects as I from a fat soluble statin."
"I have had tendonitis in my knees and troublesome pain in my lower legs and feet.
 My knee swells with fluid, so that any movement causes excrutiating pain.
 At first, I thought that this might be gout, because it runs in my family, and my toes swell up occasionally.
 But, after my doctor confirmed that my swollen knees were not gout, I began to consider other causes.
 It dawned on me to check the internet concerning the Lipitor I have been taking.
 Sure enough, many people have the same troubles.
 I used to be able to walk for endless miles.
 For about the same amount of time I have been taking this drug, I have been hobbling around, cautious of every painful step.
 Although it may lower my cholesterol, tomorrow, I will stop taking the Lipitor."
"Severe muscle pain in shoulders radiating through the chest, cramping in back muscles, calves and hamstrings.
 Severe muscle pain after working out with weights, all the while losing strength.
 Difficulty with memory at times (i.e. remembering a name or a word).
 My shoulder pain resulted in a visit to a specialist who said inflammation was present but no torn rotator cuff.
 Prescribed physical therapy which made it hurt even more.
 I first noticed the pain several months in to taking the drug.
 After an ER visit due to severe back spasm/cramp, my Cardiologist suggested going off the drug and in the past 10 days, no cramping, the shoulder pain has eased 80% and I actually feel good.
 Because of blockage issues I need to move on to another drug like Crestor or Zocar but after reading some of the comments I am concerned.
 The medication worked at lowering my cholesterol (127 with good cholesterol over 40 and bad cholesterol under 70) but at a steep price physically."
Flatulence.
"I did not link my problems to the Lipitor until my husband had major problems, now I know what has caused 10 years of Neuropathy, I have Burning feet always in bed at night, I do not have Diabetes (which would cause this) and was tested in DC at WRAMC and they found no reason that I should have this and gave me a tube of Capsacian!!!
 I still live with this.
 Four years ago I developed Frozen Shoulder in my left arm, unbelievable pain, within weeks the other shoulder became as painful as the first, could not raise my arms at all, tested at Bethesda Naval Hosp., no reason found, I was told it would last about 2 years unless I took therapy sessions, I took the sessions and begged for someone to put me out of my misery each time, it eventually passed in about a year but I still have shoulder pain.
 Today I am stopping the Lipitor, maybe I have read too much on the subject but the one that really scares me is the Memory Loss, All the drug com.
 tests were done to see how well the Statins did for Cholesterol and the heart benefits, but no testing (or none that the consumer was told of) was ever done to see how it effects the brain function.
 Memory is too precious a thing to lose to a drug!."
"Fatigue, Brain Fog, Stuttering, Bad OCD!.
 I am diabetic and my numbers weren't horrible but they want you below 100 - this drug and the statins they tried on me were not worth it at all."
"initially noticed twitching in thighs thought because im a rn it was just in my mind 5 wks into pain in ankle to point i couldnt walk went to podiatrist who ive seen for plantar fascitits and was told bones in foot collapsing mechanical problem not lipitor made orthotics put on nsaid no reief got orthotics and now on medrol dose pack having mri tommarrow will never take again.

"Severe pain & cramping in ankles, feet arches & back, Muscle weakness & atrophy-unable to exercise, Weak & wobbley ankles, knees & wrists, Cramping in wrists & hands, Rib cage tightness, Constant fatigue, Insomnia requiring a sleep lab study (which concluded that I have insomnia), Mental fogginess & forgetfulness, Pancreatitis, requiring mri & biopsies, Elevated liver enzymes-attributed to fatty liver Chest tightness & breathlessness requiring 3 day hospitalization for cardiac stress test & catherization & lung tests-negative Difficulty swallowing & swelling in throat requiring referrals to a gastro-enterologist & an ear, nose, & throat specialist: allergy testing, swallowing study x-rays, cat scan, upper GI scope with dilation of esophagus & biopsies, and finally larynx scope & biopsies-all negative Swollen nasal passages requiring sinus cat scan-negati.
 They never made any mention of adding Co Q 10.
 Over the years, I had previously been prescribed steroid nasal sprays, allegra (even though tests showed no allergies), nexium, cough medicine, sinus irrigation, & various sleeping pills to deal with what I now know was my reaction to statins.
 Nothing helped alleviate these symptoms.
 Besides the toll that statins have taken on my quality of life, I've also spent tens of thousands of dollars on doctors, drugs, tests, labs, & procedures.
 I even purchased a sleep number bed & a new sofa, thinking that would help my insomnia & back pain.
 All to no avail.
 My symptoms slowly crept up during my 15 years of statin use.
 Just 2 years ago, I walked 4 miles a day, or rode my bike for 45 minutes a day.
 I did a 20 minute Pilates machine workout 4 or 5 times a week.
 I went from being energetic & very active to being unable to even do my own grocery shopping.
 Since my daughter will be having her 2nd child in 3 months & will need my help & since I was afraid that I would be wheel chair bound by then if my symptoms kept worsening, I stopped taking Lipitor 12 days ago & I began improving slightly by the 3rd day.
 I informed my doctor, who was not happy-he now wants me to ""try"" pravachol!
 Now 12 days post-lipitor, the hot flashes & night sweats are gone entirely.
 I am sleeping 5-6 hours at night, instead of 3-4.
 The weakness in my legs & back when climbing steps is lessening.
 My arm muscles st."

 Attributed to running 15 miles per week, two 60 minute spin classes weekly, resistance training etc .
 Symptoms worsened, swelling at knee, drained 25 cc fluid.
 Orothopedic consult; x rays and MRI revealed no abnormality.
 Symptoms worsend and spread to right knee.
 After two weeks of problems, skipped one dose of Lipitor.
 36 hours after last dose, symptoms abated.
 48 hours later symptoms nearly gone.
 MD confirms decision to discontinue entirely.
 Lipitor did bring my cholesterol from 235 to 175.
 Bloodwork indicated no liver or muscle enzyme abnormilities after 7 weeks but those results are not worth the symptoms.
 Switching to Choleast an over the counter red rice yeast formula."
"Started taking Lipitor 20mg in Feb '08; in Sept '10 experienced stiff, achy joints around shoulders/arms, hips and Achilles tendons.
 Stopped 1/22/11; slowly feeling less stiff.
 Can now take shirts off over my head without wincing; not great, but better."
"I have been taking simvostatin for about 5 years,,since March 2010 i have been experiencing pain in my left leg and foot with exteem pain in my ankle and at times i have had dificultly in walking to the point were on some days i could not walk at all because the pain was so bad also had pain in my left arm as if i had strained it lifting but i havn't been lifting, this is not like me because i am normaly very fit and i love walking.
 doctor refered me to hostpital for xray on my foot which proved normal, after reading some of the threads on here i decided not to take my nightly statin (20m.gr.)
 Since i decided to give them a miss i find that the pain in my foot is subsiding and i can walk a lot better.
 i never had this problen with my foot and arm untill i took this drug,I mentioned this to my doctor who said in not many words that i should have no side effects from simvostatin.
 well i have proved him wrong.
 I can only hope that having taken this drug for 5 years that not to much d."
"Extended periods of low mood, loss of self-confidence, loss of interest in life etc also brain fog & impaired memory.
 Increased to 40mg/day in the last 6 months and then stopped taking it after reading of similiar symptoms on this website.
 After 2 weeks, the symptoms had gone and 8 weeks later they still have not returned.
 Won't be taking this anymore."

 There must be something better than this.
 I am going to try POLICOSANOL."
"muscle spasms and pain, joint pain, headaches, memory loss, skin rash, depression, insomnia.
 Although I complained to my doctor about the muscle and joint pain she insisted that I needed to take it so the fat would get out of my liver since my liver enzymes were elevated."
"Severe muscle cramping.
 Muscle weakness.
 Lipitor dropped my bad cholesterol immediately, however, I have noticed increasing muscle spasms and cramping.
 My hands, feet, legs, stomach and back muscles.
 I am trying to improve my health yet I can not sleep due to severe leg cramping.
 Crippling cramps.
 I told my Doc today that I didnt want to take Lipitor any more.
 She switched me to another brand that has less of the muscle side effects.
 My husband had to pull me out of the bath tub the other night, my thighs would not push me up!
 I now know I am not crazy.
 fingers twitching, making my mouse click on things I didnt want to click on.
 Legs twitching, especially in bed at night.
 And the awful cramps!."
"started having muscle pain in upper right side then shoulders neck etc .
 unable to walk properly after sitting for a while but the worst is being unable to sleep.
 These symptoms have developed over the years.
 Have only just come off this drug and hope the symptoms will improve."
"Eye sight appeared foggy when it was perfect before, some loss of hair, aches and pains in my back, a cough, sore ankles when I exercise.
 Sore joints.
 but even more scarey it made me depressed!
 What sort of drugs are they maiking us take?
 I'm stopping right now after finding this site.
 It did lower my CL though.
 I'm going to take Omega 3, carry on exercising and try my luck."
"Muscle weakness,lack of concentration,joint pain,abnormal liver function, ( ? ) unknown skin condition on hands.
 I was living with the initial, common side effects, but after 2 years my fingertips got puffy and/or scaly.
 In a couple weeks the skin began to come off and the condition spread to the sides of my fingers and my palms.
 I DO NOT KNOW if this is lipitor related, but after using 2 prescription ointments with little relief, I quit taking lipitor and after 1 month my hands were healed and I have had no problems since (1 yr.)
 None of my doctors can (or are unwilling) to explain this.
 They want me back on a statin drug, but I will not untill I have an answer."
"Body Pains all over, major on going muscle cramps, very bad stomach pains, nervous system problems, pushing blood presure up and up and early signs of osteoarthritis.
 Very bad not for my body type.
 Came off it to see what happens.
 I am trying some other things to control the bad cholesterol - change of diet, exercise and some other natural things.
 By stopping Lipitor my quality of life has returned.
 My bad cholesterol is fine for now the same as a normal persons reading but not as low as the doctors would like it.
 Who would think such a drug can do so much harm and is recommended by the family doctor.
 It does lower cholesterol but it also is a major contributor to other health problems."
"Depression, bursitis in left hip didn't respond to 5-6 cortisone shots, PT, toes hurt when sheet touched, MEMORY LOSS-severe, dizzyness, in a FOG bottoms of feet hurt, felt like shin splints,tingling in 2 fingers of left hand.
 Went from 1 specialist to another-no one seemed to put it together since I only said those things that related to their specialty.
 Finally fingers began to tingle psychiatrist suggested nerve damage.
 That niite I got online put in 17 symptoms no matter how unrelated & came up with this site as first choice.
 THANK YOU !
 I read & ried-I was NOT crazy!
 I hadn't included Depression as my memory retnd I checked I had been on LIPITOR years ago when I had my first MMDepression!
 I found that I had been of and on since the late 90's!
 My ex owned a pharmacy which has since closed and used to fill the Rx-he was on also.
 I'll have to depend on Drs record to estab dates.
 I have not taken any since that nite-called cardiologist office told to stay off for a mth.
 Called back this week.
 After another mth they will do more bloodwork.
 I met w/Primary Care today-ordered blood tests & referral to the Neurologist.
 Appt w/orthopedist M,PsyT, I refuse to take another statin Changed way I eat in March & #'s went Way down TC 152,Tri 70,LDL 64,HDL74.
 My mind is more imp than any drug.
 Still in PT & have pain but I can live w/that.
 Talk to Atty Fri.
 We ALL need to sue as Docs are only aware of muscle issues!."
"A friend om mine took Lipitor (all statins have similar side effects).
 He suffered terrible pains in hips, legs, hands etc Lost his muscular strength, had difficulties to swallow, problems with tinnitus and memory.
 The problems appeared little by little over the years.
 The best thing you can do for yourself and others is to educate yourself on this - and other medical issues.
 Read books, read patient stories and look at The Lipitor Paradox at u-tube.
 It`s a very funny and sad story.
 Also visit spacedoc.net for more information about side effects."
"After taking Crestor and having muscle pain and lack of control when standing in the mornings, my Dr prescribed Lipitor.
 I have had increasing non stop Pain in neck and back and now severe tingling and burning in hands and feet with itchy crawly feeling all over.
 My bad levels have decreased but now I am afraid I may have nerve damage or liver problems and after reading this sites comments will stop taking Lipitor."
"A few weeks after taking lipitor my ankles and the soles of my feet feels like I was walking on hot coals I blamed my new shoes i bought.
 So I bought a new pair from the chemist they didn't stop the pain either.
 I was at a local club about 2 months later walked into the toilet I'd been in there many times before but this I couldn't work out witch door to walk out(I think it also has an effect on your memory).
 Also I suffer badly from muscle pain from my neck & shoulders to my lower back.
 My wife also took lipitor but has since stopped but it effected her a lot worse than me.
 She has since stopped taking any medication it's been 6 months and still recovering from the effects.
 I am now taking Ezetrol a lot better.
 I still get pains in my back but not as bad.
 I just wish the doctors would tell you about the side affects to expect."
"headaches, face and scalp tingling, scalp itching, vibrating under scalp, tinnitus, twitching mouth, insomnia, vivid dreams, difficult swallowing/choking, swollen tongue,memory loss, confusion,stomach pain, left foot pain.
 59 year old female with diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and high cholestrol/triglycerides.
 Neurologist, cardiologist, and internist stated my symptoms were not all related to Lipitor side effects.
 After trying Zocor, Provachol, Zetia and Crestor, Lipitor seemed to be the lessor of the evils with regard to side effects.
 However, due to heart problems, cardiologist gradually increased the Lipitor dosage from 10mg to 40mg.
 Symptoms have been gradual over the years with recent face and scalp problems diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia after MRI ruled out tumor or MS.
 After reading your comments regarding Liptior, I have decided to reduce the dosage from 40mg to 20mg for a week to see if this relieves the most recent symptoms.
 If improvement is noted, then I will contact my doctor for a further reduction in the dosage to determine if other symptoms abate.
 I appreciate all the feedback on this medication and will keep you posted on my progress."
"within 24 hrs i was having direar, severe muscle aces, headace, collapades in the floor on the third day, called the dr, went back he did a liver test and took me off the medicane, but was still having symptoms, in 5 days i had blisters on my finger and palms of my hands, and on the soles of my feet, the blisters lasted 1 and a half years, my hands and feet would bleed, i saw another dr and he did tell me it was because of the lipitor, till this day i am still having problems, i still have muscle aces, memory loss, i don,t think my kidney,s are as good, i fell like my body is being attacked in different places in seems to come and go about every three weeks, i will have severe headaces, this has been 3 years ago, i think it did perment damage to me, some times i wonder when i am going to die, i forget things all the time, and even forgot how to get to the dr,s office once, i even forget my grandaughter name from time, im only 52 years of age, to young to have all this problems, iam so.
 always find a alternative, if you have lipitor trash it."
"Not much -- occasional itchiness.
 I was taking Red Yeast statins for chlolesterol of 230, but then big-pharma got in the picture and made that illegal.
 Don't know if that is still the case.
 My doctor said Lipitor was the most tested statin drug.
 My real concern is heart disease which is in my family.
 Not sure of how tight the correlation is between low chlosterol numbers and low risk of coronary problems.
 AMA dumbs down the information to make is sound like getting down to ridiculous levels (100) insures that you won't have problems.
 I doubt it.
 Probably much more based on genetic history.
 So Lipitor is great for reducing your numbers, but extending your life ???."
"Severe B/L shoulder pain, general weakness, malaise, and slight memory loss.
 I started out at 10 mg every day for 7 years, 20 mg for 1 year, 40 then 80 for over 1 1/2 years.
 Over the past year, B/L shoulder pain to the point of wearing a sling because it hurt badly when I walked.
 I read about the shoulder pain in assorted sites on the web.
 Discussed it with my PA and cardiologist.
 My PA stopped the Lipitor.
 The pain lessened but did not stop.
 Went to a Ortho MD who gave me 3 Steroid shots and PT.
 It seemed to help but pain would not stop.
 Narcs were ordered which helped somewhat but wasn't the answer.
 MRI showed a slight linear tear in my Rotator Cuff which he wanted to do surgery.
 Decided against surgery.
 Both shoulders started to feel better but still couldn't sleep on my left side.
 My LDL's were through the roof.
 After almost 10 months off Lipitor, my general MD talked me into starting Sinivastatin 40 mg every day.
 Well, guess what happened.
 My shoulder pain suddenly worsen, especially left side.
 I am going to speak with my Cardiologist again and explore alternatives and will be stopping my Statin today!
 Moral of the story.
 Stay clear of Statin medications."
"Muscle Fatigue, Memory Loss, Cramping, Cold Extremities, Shortness of Breath, General Fatigue, Joint and Muscle Pain, Inability to Sleep and induced Depression.
 This Med was Prescribed to help control Scaling - not really necessary as all my blood work was within range.
 I could not recommend this Medication to anyone, just too many side affects."
"constant pain in right thigh, abdominal pain, intermittent pain throughout body, unable to walk more than 1/8 mile w/o excruciating pain in the leg, tingling of feet, elevated liver function.
 wicked drug.
 wonder how much my doc was compensated by the drug company for prescribing it."
"Insomnia, vivid nightmares when I did sleep, muscle pain, weakness, tired all the time, depression to the point of considering suicide.
 Statins are damaging to so many body processes.
 The clinical trials for FDA approval weren't nearly long enough to observe all the adverse effects.
 We're in the REAL clinical trials now, while lining the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies.
 I take grape juice and cider vinegar now - it reduces cholesterol and blood pressure with no side effects."
"Have suffered from leg cramps(principally at night) since beginning 40 mg Lipitor, 5 years ago, after a mild heart attack.
 Cardiologist offered no suggestions.
 After trying numerous recommendation for this problem such as potassium, magnesium, vitamin E, etc with no effect, my family doctor suggested that I stop taking Lipitor for 3 days, and see if it has any effect.
 The effect was dramatic.
 The cramps did not occur during the night after I did not take the 40 mg with my dinner.
 They also did not occur on the following two nights.
 I did not want to restart the Lipitor (once a day with the evening meal) for fear that the cramps would just as quickly return.
 Since it was possible that the reason why the night cramps ceased so quickly is that I was taking the 40 mg entirely in the evening, I decided to split the pills and take half in the morning and half in the evening.
 Although some mild cramping did return, it was nowhere close to what I had been experiencing, and this has c."
"Was doing fine on it for years.
 I unfortunately was diagnosed with Colin cancer and had to start chemotherapy.
 The combo of chemo and Lipitor caused my liver enzymes to rise, muscle and joint stiffness as well as sore ribs.
 I have been off Lipitor for two days and find the muscle stiffness starting to subside."
"Severe chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, problems with memory, concentration.
 Severe depression.
 Cholesterol went down drastically, doctors were thrilled, but I spent a year feeling exhausted and weak, unable to find words or remember names or follow the plot of a movie.
 All I thought about was where and when I could lie down.
 I was hardly able to lift things I could easily lift before.
 Legs would go wobbly after one flight of stairs.
 Everything was exhausting.
 Doing the shopping or vacuuming was like climbing Everest.
 Symptoms stopped within a week of stopping Lipitor.
 I can't believe I spent a year of my life like that.
 I will not recommend against Lipitor because some people do fine on it but I wish my Drs. had been more open to the idea that it was causing me problems.
 The only side effect they asked about was muscle pain, which I didn't have, and I was basically told Lipitor doesn't cause anything else."
"headaches, pain in throat , tingling in side of face, severe bouts of anxiety and depression-loss of reason to live!
 nausea.
 does lower my cholestoral."
"Ruined my physical ability to do anything.
 Muscles no more.
 Weak all the time.
 I will never take another one these pills.
 Doctors are pill pushers getting paid by the drug makers.
 Wake up America !!."
"tingling and aches in hands, chest discomfort, difficulty breathing, stuffy nose, weakness in legs, back pain.
 This drug is the worst.
 I stopped using it after 17 days when I started experiencing chest pains and difficulty breathing.
 Its side effects are horrible and it should be taken off the market.
 I do not recommend this drug to anyone."
"My levels went from 518 down to 175 to 190.
 No muscle pain or side effects.
 I also take 2000 MG of Niacin a day.
 Liver functions normal."
not sleeping and geting bad swets all night only happends when i take the tab.
"Severe back pain muscles pain loss of energy, depression.
 My doctor put me on several other drugs to heal these pains- thyroid, testonrone, trazadone.
 I just went to a naturopath and stopped the Lipitor.
 Since stopping lipitor I feel I am getting my life back."
"Muscle aches and weakness in neck, arms, shoulders, upper back, legs.
 Severe pain in left foot and third and fourth toes.
 Pain and weakness increased until I needed help dressing and combing my hair.
 I could not do daily activities such as pick up a cup of coffee or put on a seatbelt without significant pain.
 The ball of my left foot was so painful I could not put pressure on it when walking so I walked on the side of my foot.
 Symptoms began 12 weeks after starting Lipitor.
 I reported to my cardiologist and internist who both denied problems were related to Lipitor because my CPK was only mildly elevated (250).
 I also saw a podiatrist, chiropractor, and spine specialist with no relief.
 When it got so bad I could not take it anymore and did not care about my cholesterol I took myself off of Lipitor and got a 50% improvement after one week.
 I then saw a neurologist who diagnosed me with statin induced myalgia.
 He said he sees a lot of patients with slightly elevated CPK that many physicians do not recognized as a symptom of a statin intolerance.
 I have been off of Lipitor for two years and continue to improve very slowly, but I still suffer from some pain and weakness.
 I can now walk normal, but my toes are still quite painful at times."
"Stomach problems, muscle pain, mood swings, headaches, joint pain."
"I have done very well with Lipitor for the last 2 1/2 years.
 It has reduced my cholesterol significantly-from over 300 to under 150.
 Two weeks ago I was given the new generic.
 This week I noticed that all my fingers and toes were tingling, a pins and needles feeling.
 It was like they had fallen asleep.
 I immediately went back to pharmacy and got brand name again (luckily my insurance pays-it will be $15/ 3 month supply more, but it's worth it).
 I have noticed just within the last two days the tingling is gone.
 Thank goodness!
 I read that generics have the same active ingredients, but there may be a difference in how the medicine is released.
 It's not EXACTLY the same.
 High cholesterol runs in my family and I am greatful that Lipitor can help me manage this."
"Since taking the smaller round tablet I have been having leg cramps.
 I have confirmed this by not taking for two days at a time then taking them.
 Usually the cramps start that night after resuming the new smaller tablet.
 My guess is there has been a change in method of manufacture or supplier.
 I will seek out a natural way to reduce my cholesterol.
 By the blood test results this drug does not increase my HDL, both HDL and LDL readings are less than 2.
 Australia and New Zealand measurement."
"I was tired, had muscle cramps, uneasiness = felt HORRIBLE.
 I stopped taking it.
 I will continue with better diet and physical activity after experiencing really bad side effects when trying the same stunt with ZETIA."
"Bouts of extreme forgetfulness, extreme muscle pain, insomnia, tremors, cluster headaches,kidney pain, urinary problems.
 Became unable to walk without a cane, unable to sleep, kidney problems (urine like root beer).
 I had a high stress detail oriented job that I lost due to inability to think fast enough to manage.
 I went from being a SMEE (subject matter expert)to crying in front of my computer unable to function.
 Couldn't find words, got lost on way to grocery store etc Dr kept telling me it couldn't be any of the meds I was on.
 Finally Googled symptoms and first hit was Spacedoc and there was my answer.
 Within 2 days of stopping I had noticeable mental improvement.
 I stopped it 8 weeks ago and still have much muscle pain and fatigue.
 Kidneys have cleared, but will still give me problems if I fatigue myself.
 I think it is a poison, some people do need statans I guess, but not me!."
"My mother developed dementia while taking this terrible drug.
 Since stopping she has not improved and now needs 24/7 care."
"Torn ham string.
 Had months of aquatic therapy & it did not help.
 Finally I had such pain in both legs in my upper thigh and upper leg by my hip area that I could hardly stand it.
 I had noticed 5 years prior to this that my muscles seemed to never feel the same as before I started on a statin drug.
 I kept thinking is this old age.
 It got so bad that I could hardly walk after sitting for any period of time.
 I finally called my doctor and was advised to stop the statin drug.
 It took a few months for the pain to subside.
 I took 40 Mg for 10 years.
 It brought my cholestrol down but I could not stand all of the muscle pain."
"Severe skin rash to my upper thighs .
 The itch and pain is unbearable to the point you cant sleep or bear to wear your trousers."
MOVE SLOW EYE HEAVY .NO SLEEP AT NIGHT AND DAY TIME NO SLEEP IN FOUR WEEK !.
"Paranoia, anxiety.
 It sure reduced my LDL cholesterol as well as triglycerides - but the psychiatric side effects were harsh."
"Muscle aches.
 now have fibromyalgia.
 Memory, learning problems, brain fog, depression, extreme fatigue.
 In horrible pain, I quit taking it and replaced it with natural therapies.
 Starting to feel better.
 I hope and pray the damage isn't permanent.
 This medication is nothing but a pharmaceutical money maker.
 It should be banned!!
 I wish I would have known the side effects when I started taking it, instead of dealing with extreme pain for so many years!."
"Terrible burning/numb sensation in hands & feet.
 Joint pain is worse than pre surgery!
 My chiropractor advised me to look at this website.
 Will be quitting this.
 Since surgery, I've suddenly gone on blood pressure, cholesterol & diabetes meds.
 Never had these problems before."
"Numbness in feet, leg, hip, neck cramps, eyes running, itchy and watery all the time like I was crying.
 Depression, itching all the time.
 Makes you feel 25 years older.
 I quit taking it most problems gone in 3 weeks.
 I will try to control with diet and exercise, and omega 3 fish oil, will never take a large dose again would rather eat nothing than take that poison."
"Rough anxiety and paranoia.
 To be fair, I must note that I was also taking Norvasc - a blood pressure pill and when the above symptoms persisted I stopped Norvasc at once (replaced with Diovan).
 However, at that time - over a month ago - I was only aware of Norvasc's side effects and, indeed, when I stopped taking it most of the anxiety and paranoia symptoms disappeared - most, but not all.
 That is when I started looking for the other culprit.
 Sure discovered it soon: Lipitor.
 Spoke to a psychiatrist and she confirmed that the entire family of Norvasc (called amlodiphine) is known to have psychiatric side effects.
 A month ago my family physician confirmed that Lipitor is guilty of similar symptoms and agreed to let me off it for three months, until I take my next blood test.
 Meanwhile I'm now on health food as well as Q10, Omega III, Nosterol and Vitamin E (200IU).
 I now hope that LDL is low enough to say to Lipitor goodbye.
 Time will tell."
"ALL AND SOME NOT NOTED - KIDNEY-METAL MOODS-ANZITY-SUGAR LEVEL DROPS - STOMACH ULCER-JOINT PAIN- MEMORY TROUBLE- PUT ON MORE MEDS- LIPITOR ADMITED TO GIVING KIDNEY TROUBLES TO ME -I TOOK OTHER S WITH SAME TROUBLES AND MORE.
 I TOOK MANY SATIN DRUGS FOR 5 YEARS OF HORROR, THEY ALMOST KILLED ME, I WAS 45 , 55 NOW AND STILL HAVE HEALTH TROUBLES RELATED TO THESE MEDS, MOSTLY DEJESTIVE SYSTEM AND STOMACH ULCERS- ALMOST A YEAR NOW TAKING MEDS TO HEAL MY STOMACH- CANCER?

"Muddled thinking, loss of strength and stamina."
"Extreme tummy bloating.
 Tight chest.
 Headache.
 Mood swings.
 Awful gas tummy pains cold shivers."
"Leg, arm, shoulder, and foot pain.
 Neuropathy in feet.
 Constant pain!
 Loss of energy.
 Difficulty thinking and speaking in a glib fashion.
 Disturbed sleep patterns.
 Difficulty urinating.
 Increase in blood pressure from below normal to slightly above normal, lack of sexual desire.
 Less muscle mass even though I force myself to work out at least four times per week ( usually five).
 Decreased energy and constant lethargy.
 .
 Although it lowers wy cholesterol levels appropriately, it seems to have given me debilitating side effects that have decreased my enjoyment of life in general.
 I fear stopping the lipitor because I fear a heart attack.
 Bt I hate the side effects!
 I take vitamin c, fish oil capsules, CO Q 10, eat well, am allergic to red meat and have not eaten any in more than 35 years.
 I eat salad everyday for lunch, eat fruit and vegetables daily, and take many vitamins and supplements ( astaxanthan, MSM, alpha lipoid acid, vit. B complex, 500mg of time release Niacin, and more).
 One would expect me to be healthy and have a ton of energy, but instead, I feel Ike I have one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel.
 I attribute all the negatives to the Lipitor.
 The worst of all the side effects is the horrible pain in my feet ( I have professionally prescribed orthotics in my shoes at all times)."
"Mostly Pain, Pain, Pain.
 Deep throbbing pain in my joints and muscles.
 Hair loss, insomnia, tinnitus, dysphagia.
 Neurologist diagnosed me with MS.
 Feet hurt so badly, I could not walk.
 The prescribing physician shrugged off my complaints.
 I stopped taking Lipitor when I went into a coma in June 2000.
 It took me 12 years to recover.
 Lipitor created the same problems that Zocor had caused.
 I took for Zocor for six years.
 The prescribing physician ignored my complaints.
 This nightmare took 20 years out of my life.
 I kept detailed records.
 You can see a summary here: http://morleyevans2.com/Depraved/Depraved.html
 I got better.
 Please contact me at //////////// if you need help."
"Anxiety, paranoia.
 I went to see my doctor and told him about my discovery.
 First he was a bit reluctant but in the following meeting he already told me that he had read about Lipitor's psychiatric side effects.
 He therefore put me off Lipitor completely and suggested a much lower dosage of 10mg Crestor.
 In addition, he prescribed a new medication: Niacin, beginning with 500mg the first month and then increasing to 1,000 in the second (with the ultimate aim of reaching 2,000 in the fourth monthly).
 Bottom line: When I discontinued Lipitor two months ago my LDL reached 165.
 This week my blood test indicated an LDL level of 124.
 So, after being helped by folks on this website I hope I can be of some help to others who suffer from statin side effects.
 Therefore, here is what I've done during the past two months: - Took 500mg of Niacin during the first months and 1,000mg during the second; - Took a total of 10 Crestor pills (10mg which are equivalent to 20mg of Lipitor) per month, i.e., one every three days.
 - Two natural pills of Phytosterol.
 - A cup of tea made of olive leafs.
 Now, I do believe that when I reach the maximum intake of Niacin in two months (2,000mg) the LDL will drop from 124 to 100 (the level required for diabetics).
 Good luck, folks!."
"Second time trying this.
 First time I got a frozen shoulder.
 Triedit a couple of years later and I have back and chest pain that made think i was having a cardio event.
 Stopped the Lipitor about a week ago and still having horrible back pain.
 If this stuff is damaging my muscles what is it doing to my major muscle.
 my HEART!
 This is a terrible drug! DO NOT TAKE!
 I would rather take the risk of elevated lipids!."
"I am writing this for my husband.
 He initially took 10mg every other day several years ago but would complain of muscle soreness and tore a calf muscle while running once.
 At that point he stopped the Lipitor and improved.
 Fast forward 3 years, he went to dr for check up (he has known coronary disease) and was started back on Lipitor 20mg.
 At about 2 months in, he had nausea and sweating occasionally.
 One month later he ended up in hospital for coronary disease and dose up to 40.
 After 1 more month had episodes of extreme fatigue, increased belching, stomach discomfort and leg heaviness, low bp and pulse.
 Like the flu without fever.
 Hospitalized and cathed again but heart arteries were fine and previously placed stents open Dr stopped blood pressure meds and Lipitor.
 He was back to normal in a week.
 We thought it was the Toprol at first due to low bp and pulse also.
 So started back on Lipitor and within a week felt horrible again.
 Stopped it a week ago and will NOT go back on it."
"Extreme fatigue, general muscle aches, dark urine, burning back pain."
"went from very active to severe leg muscle and buttocks cramps as well as aches and pains.
 basically a whole body feeling like i had the flu.
 No sex drive.
 Short term memory problems.
 Could not walk up stairs with anything in my hands more than about 5-10 lbs.
 Bad feeling of dread and depression.
 Could no longer mow my yard with a self propelled lawn mower with out having to stop and let leg muscles recover after about 10 steps.
 I have been off medication for over 6 years and am still not back to my prior self.
 Just recently leg muscles have come back to about 50% of what they used to be.
 I can not run or workout any longer for fear of getting hurt.
 This is a very dangerous and horrible drug.
 This drugs side effects were not explained to me by my doctor as being so risky.
 I am 5'9 and 160 lbs.
 high cholesterol is a family trait through several generations."
"Still have pain in feet and legs, since Dr made me continue this Lipitor (Crippling Medicine from Hell) & when I refused to take it the 2nd time, even though they continued to tell me that I could DIE if I did not take it, with my response being that I could live with agonizing pain and be disabled on this medication or possibly NOT DIE from this medication and still provide for my family by working.
 That was Long ago & my Feet still hurt so bad by the end of my work day, because they decided I should take Simcor in its place.
 Now I had no ideas at the time about Statin drugs until I found this website, I had been on Simcor for 1 Month & stopped it immediately when I realized that it was perpetuating my Foot/ankle pain.
 I will never take any Statin drugs again, & my Cholesterol is lower from my change in diet.
 Do NOT fall for the Statin Drug Scam, as Big Pharma runs our little Family Dr Offices with Lunches & boxes full of Sample drugs, to either give to patien.
 Never take this Drug or any other Statin Drug, as it has never been proven that Cholesterol will Kill you, especially when I know people who are not over weight and eat right only to have there Hi # above 400 and it is Genetic, with no one dying from Heart attacks in there Family's.
 So many books out today about the Statin Drug Lies!."

 By end of day I am in extreme pain, and can barely walk."
"At the beginning I didn't experience any side effects at all on 10 mg.
 It did lower my cholesterol.
 In my 2nd year I started having very bad leg cramps in the night and spinning head when laying down.
 In the 8th year my sugar started to go up which I am tested for every 6 months.
 In my 11th year I have now developed Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) as well as still all the above side effects.
 When I did research I read that all of the side effects I am experiencing have most likely been cause from taking Lipitor for a long time.
 I have now decided to stop taking Lipitor before something else happens to me.
 Too bad all of this showed up after so many years."
"Unusually fatigued in afternoon.
 Felt lazy and unmotivated to do anything.
 Went off them cold turkey early May and rededicated myself to a low carb/paleo diet.
 Now focusing on TRIG/HDL ratio, TRIGlyceride levels, and keeping blood sugar in acceptable range.
 Ratios and numbers have significantly improved and weight has dropped another 15 lbs although LDL has gone up (probably due to increase in dietary saturated fats).
 Will retest (out of pocket) in a few months to see if my numbers improve.
 Fatigue and laziness is gone and afternoon energy levels are high (as indicated by no yawning!)."

 I'm miserable and used to be quite healthy and active.
 It should be taken off market.
 We should be compensated.
 It's changed my life and I think of the loss every single day.
 I get 4 pain free days per year."
"stiff neck, sore left testicle ,arm muscles melting,legs feel like they don't belong to me."
"fatigue, depression, hand and feet joint pains so very severe, dysfunctional bowel, muscle aches, no energy.
 patients need to realize that the statins block the mevalonate pathway that leads to ubuquinol which is the catalyst for all energy formation in the human body, this is catastrophic and must be treated by cessation of statin and 200mg. of ubiquinol twice a day, takes time to reverse side effects."
"Overall decline in life.
 Depression, severe and persistent musclo-skeletal pain, insomnia, gas, severe rectal bleeding, nausea, stomach pain, syncope and more.
 After ten years of misery I stopped taking lipitor/atorvastatin, on the advice of my doctor, for a week to relieve severe shoulder pain, which I extended to ten days when I noticed an amazing improvement in my general well-being and after the ten days felt so much better I stopped taking it altogether.
 For those who feel a long life is preferable to a good life, this drug may be worth taking; for those who have enjoyed life and would prefer a slightly shorter one to a longer miserable one, stopping it is not a bad idea.
 Trust me - I get up every morning feeling a thousand times better, stay busy and active all day long and feel as I used to feel before I started taking this drug.
 and ALL of the symptoms have completely disappeared."
"drive is knocked down including sex drive.
 After stent (LDL was 72) Doc increased my dose to 40MG.
 LDL is 44 and it lowered HDL.
 One size does not fit all, if you are 50 or over and your family has heart issues, this may help.
 CHANGE YOUR LIFE EAT LESS FAT (NO RED MEAT) and watch your diet, exercise.
 We goofed off until now and now do it for the kids."
"Severe and prolonged leg, ankle, toe muscle pain every night.
 Doctor said it was not the lipitor.
 went off it myself.
 Now off 6 myths.
 NO more muscle pain!."
"became more anxious about EVERYTHING, and noticed words would not form in my head during conversations, was disturbing and couldn't figure out why these things were happening.
 made me think i needed antidepressants or something to deal with constant anxiety/fear (which i have taken before and are horrible to get off of) have noticed slightly more tingling and weird pains, so I think this is a perfect time to stop taking this.
 I agree with another post.
 what are they doing to us, in the interest of healing us?
 I did take the actual lipitor for several yrs, and it did lower cholesteral, but started experiencing the muscle tingley thing and stopped , then started with the Atorvastatin, where i noticed the above side affects.
 be very aware of any physical/emotional changes."
"Chest muscle pains.
 Pins and needles in legs and arms.
 Numbness in fingers, reduced hand grip power.
 Numbness/pain in back.
 Numbness/headache in forehead.
 Numbness in mouth.
 Headache that lasts for days.
 My sight also gets tired from computer a lot easier than before.
 The week I started to take I had the chest ache, confirmed to be muscular by doctors.
 At the start of the second week, I accidentally took a dose in the morning instead of the night because I took the wrong pill (skipped the night dose).
 The day after I started to have the other symptons.
 The worst one - the mouth one has faded, but the others remain.
 I found out too late grapefruit juice can make this drug stronger.
 I drank it some days during the first 2 weeks.
 Stopped drinking it.
 At the beginning of third week I took 50mg of CoQ10 per day for 3 days.
 I couldn't sense an improvement, but after stopping for other three days I will try again.
 (I need better evidence before buying a can of CoQ10, it is very expensive and hard to find around here).
 Will beg my cardiologist to let me try natural exercise before continuing statins.
 Giving it a 3, because it was effective , in a single month and with ezetimibe and exercise all my numbers are in very safe ranges.
 Please be careful about natural supplements.
 Homeopathy simply does not work - it is just water - The supplements that do work may also have side effects, just like the drugs.
 Red Yeast Rice, for example, actually contains a statin (lovastatin) , so it will most likely have all the set of side effects as the other statins."
"headache, gas, bloating, mood swings, ill feeling, paranoid, anxious.
 My Dr said my cholesterol was very high.
 SO she put me on Lipitor.
 I was so sick over Christmas Holiday and did not know why.
 Could not eat, sleep.
 felt so gassy and my belly blew up like a balloon.
 When I stopped taking it, I felt back to normal.
 Ill do it naturally with eating healthily with salmon and olive oil and veggies."
"Severe lethargy, general body pain, severe pain of the hip joint, limping now.
 Should be discount inked from the market, causing more evil than good."
"Before I was put on Lipitor for high cholesterol, I had an echo done, normal results.
 1 year after I have been taking it, and losing 20 pounds, took another echo and showed that I was in stage 1 diastolic dysfunction in left ventricular.
 Plus my right ventricular was mildly dilated.
 Also I had elevated calcium in my blood test.
 never did I have that prior to taking Lipitor.
 My dr. said diastolic dysfunction can come from age.
 I am only 53 yrs old!
 I have low blood pressure, I do not have coronary artery disease, I am not a diabetic.
 This past year I lost 20 pounds which should put my heart in the healthy stage.
 looked up Lipitor and DD and showed a connection that the Lipitor altered my heart function!."
"I experienced permanent nerve damage to my feet & severe leg cramping.
 Symptoms started as a warming sensation on my lower legs after a few months and progressed to the permanent nerve damage.
 I discontinued taking Lipitor over 5 years ago.
 My feet are now simultaneously numb and painful.
 DO NOT TAKE THIS DANGEROUS DRUG.
 BE VERY AWARE OF THE PERMANENT NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES."
"i develop cataract some time muscle ache.
 great drug to control cholestrol."
"I have been taken for approximately 4 yrs.
 I have some difficulty with digestive system and some muscle pain and joint pain.
 Lipitor did the job on my cholesterol both LDL and HDL.
 I have quit taken recently to see if it affects above problems.
 It probably is a trade off.
 I feel that the drug is too expensive.
 I do think that it will do what it is used for, but I think your body pays a price.
 Again I think it is a trade off."
"I experienced severe pain in my left shoulder and neck.
 Unable to raise my left arm.
 Am still in physical therapy after 1 year, and my arm and neck are still unable to move very well.
 I am also seeing an orthopedic surgeon, who took x-rays and cannot see anything on them.
 He diagnosed it as frozen shoulder.
 Funny, that it only began when I started the Lipitor.
 I took myself off it 4 months ago, and am still in pain and cannot sleep well at night.
 My doctor never warned me about eating grapefruit, which I had every morning while taking the Lipitor."
"Knee and hip joint pain.
 Had experienced knee joint pain in past, but never hip.
 stopped taking lipitor ten days ago; joint symptoms were gone within four days for first time in six weeks (been on it four months).
 Remaining issue is chest spasm -- have been through tests ruling out heart, GERD, pneumonia, etc Spasms persist although less and less.
 Last 48 hours, epsiodes seemed to increase again but may be attributable to some combination of muscle weakness and heavy non-stop rains we've enjoyed for several days.
 Cholesterol news is great -- two days after I stopped, cholesterol was measured at 172 with excellent HDL, LDL and triglyceride levels -- down from 295 in May, consistent with the last ten years of cholesterol readings for me.
 Tests also showed no calcium build-up on my arteries one week ago.
 Was on a dose of 40 mg.
 Will see how muscle symptoms are in a month and try to resume at 10 mg.
 Does anyone know how long they think it should take symptoms to go away?."
"Muscle cramping, fatigue and depression.
 Wondering if anyone else has experienced depression?."
"the muscle spasms in my legs were so bad I had difficulty climbing 4 stairs - highly unusual for me.
 you need to keep on top of these drugs because the dr. doesn't always monitor enough.
 I wouldn't have known what was wrong with me if I hadn't seen an ad on t.v. for this med. describing side effects.
 Dr said it was vitamin C deficiency.
 I stopped the lipitol and the symptoms went away.
 I would have believed the dr. if it weren't for a kind pharmacist who said I should get a second opinion."
"Suffered from depression after taking lipitor but did not realize connection.
 Stopped taking lipitor and depression left within days.
 I wouldn't take lipitor in any dose at any time.
 It made me realize the dangers of drugs."
"Started on 10mg, dose doubled to 20mg then to 40 mg.
 Experienced severe muscle pains, cramps, sore leg joints which increased with raising of dose, walking more than a few hundred yards became difficult.
 I did not associate symptoms with tablets until I researched the Web.
 I have stopped taking the tablets for nearly a month now and and I am much improved, though my knees still ache.
 HDL/LDL balance much improved, but I would not want to start taking Lipitor again as I feel it disrupted my life considerably.
 Even though statistically (anecdotally)I am part of a small minority suffering side effects, I would still urge caution when taking this medication."
"Calf muscle strains.
 Had been taking 20mg 3x/wk with excellent cholesterol reduction for 1 yr+.
 Have also been running 2-3/wk during same time.
 3 mos ago got muscle strain in right calf that lasted 4 months.
 One month ago got severe muscle pull/strain in left calf.
 Each time I have had to quit running for several wks.
 Just tonight did I do a web search on lipitor and calf pain and now am pretty convinced it is the Lipitor from all I have read on this site.
 Was collegiate distance runner and have run off and on for years - NEVER in 25 yrs have I had a pulled/strained calf till now!
 Will stop Lipitor for now and try to resume running -once my muscle pull heals and hopefully it won't recur."
"muscle pain in thighs and legs.
 Off for 6 weeks with no improvement.
 I'm afraid it may be permanent.
 CPK test slightly elevated."
"After a few months I started having pain in different areas of my body and headaches almost everyday.
 Now I am in servere pain everywhere and trouble sitting or standing or sleeping because staying still increases pain so I have to keep moving around.
 Frequent headaches and stomache aches, daily.
 Go from extremely tired for days and nights to unable to sleep until 5 and wake up at 7 and anxiety all day.
 I have to take two cholosterol medications because lipitor doesn't work by itself.
 I definitely would not recommend taking Lipitor.
 I keep telling the NP that I don't like it but she says its working so I have to stay with it."
"Absent mindendness, trouble concentrating, blurred vision, headaches.
 I am satisfied as the drug has been hugely successful on my Cholesterol levels.
 However, I am posting this due to my side effects which I have linked to the drug."
"Did not help to lower my cholesterol, 55 put on 60 pounds.
 Will die on this medication - all my symptons on your site - hubby will get off as well (he's having eye problems).
 I have the rash on the forehead, insomnia (big time), sweats (so severe), difficulty breathing (huge athlete before all of this) - but no matter what I did - weight increased - huge bloating of stomach and difficulty breathing.
 Rashes on arms and legs as well.
 Tightness of throat at night (choking easily all the time - especially on crackers).
 Pravachol was the worst - or so I thought until I read all of this.
 My muscles have diminished greatly.
 Thanks 4 all of your input.
 (Also very aggitated and easily excited)."
"Jan.15th,2006.
 I've only been taking lipitor for a week but I'm glad I came across this site as I myself have already been experiencing dizziness, lightheadedness bloating ,excess gas adn mild stiffness of my fingers.
 Not to mention feeling tired all the time."
"My brother experienced memory loss and paranoia, leading to a uncharacteristic suicide.
 No history of mental illness or suicide in the family.
 No motivation for suicide (police investigation is ongoing).
 His experience of the side effects apparently frightened him into suicide.
 He also seems to have had hallucinations.
 Extremely dangerous drug."
"stomach pain,dizzy spells,hairloss,fatigue,dry eyes, joint pain.
 When I stopped taking Lipitor,I was amazed at how much better I began to feel.
 While taking Lipitor I had stomach cramps every day.
 I was tired, and could not function normal."
"Arm stiffness.
 Dizziness.
 Been feeling horrible the past 2 years and have gone to several doctors.
 I've been an off and on user of Lipitor for 5 years -- 10 MG dosage.
 Cholestorol lowered but started developing neurological problems about 3 months ago after restarting the drug leading to Major stiffness in right shoulder, then right arm and now left arm.
 Stopped taking Lipitor 10 days ago.
 Hopefully arm symptoms will subside."
"Constant gas and constipation.
 It has reduced my cholesterol level."
"tiredness, some back pain."
"Have been on Lipitor 3 months.
 It did lower my cholesterol from 215 to 168.
 However, I had been feeling more fatigued and now I am getting severe shoulder, neck and back pain.
 Now my feet are getting sore.
 I am a medical transcriptionist and do a lot of typing, but my hands are so painful, I can hardly sleep at night.
 I am waiting right now for my doctor to call me back.
 My hands feel cold and tingly now.
 Now I am having constipation problems.
 I cannot believe how painful my arms and shoulders are.
 It works for cholesterol, but I feel like a truck hit me.
 Since reading all of the comments, I know it is not in my head !
 I feel horrible."
"I am experiencing severe hip joint pain, thigh pain, severe thigh fatigue upon minimal exertion which is drastically impairing the ability to walk anything beyond a relatively short distance.
 The question is.
 is lipitor causing this?
 I am taking 20 mg a day and have been taking this for 6 years.
 This has been a huge problem for the last 2.5 years.
 I read this website and feel that lipitor is causing my pain.
 I have been to numberous orthopods, rheumetoligists, neouroligist, and others who cannot find any problems.
 So, when I read about all these people who seem to have figured this out .
 I have hope.
 But are they correct in thier assumptions?
 We are all desperate to find an answer (the cause) and ultimately a cure.
 But is lipitor the answer?
 That is the question (DP 2/02/06."
muscle ache.
"After taking Lipitor for several months, and gradually incrasing my dose to 40mg, I started to get EXTREMELY fatigued.
 I had to take a nap every day for 2 - 3 hours.
 After discontinuing the medicine, my energy levels bounced back to normal.
 It really helped lower my cholesterol, but have to wonder what it was doing to me to make me so tired."
"weakness, fatigue, muscle spasms, stiffness all over, achilles tendonitis that won't heal, flu-like symptoms, feeling like an old lady .
 I've been on Lipitor for almost 2 years as a booster for a type of kidney malfunction.
 Over that time I've gradually become weaker, stiff, and low in energy and over the past few weeks I've developed flu like syptoms and muscle spasms.
 My achilles tendonits just won't get better despite 3 months of PT.
 I saw my doctor about this today and he suggested going off the Lipitor to see if it was causing this.
 Thank you all for posting such enlightening information.
 I hope that we all do better off this drug!."
Joint and muscle pain; leg and foot cramping.
"Pectoral chest pain- stabbing sharp pains, increasing in frequency as time passed.
 My cholesterol was already great at 140 with triglicerides good too.
 Doctor wanted me to start this medication, 5mg/day, along with Mavik 1mg for blood pressure (mine was already averaging 106/70)to prevent arterial damage due to my type 2 diabetes.
 My total cholesterol was lowered to 128 and triglicerides to 56 after a year with a 2.something ratio.
 Heart disease runs in my mother's side of the family and bp problems and the diabetes in my dad's side.
 I have been on this dose for 1 year and noticed pains beginning after several months and the pains are getting more frequent and noticible.
 I am off the drug for a self trial period to see if the pains diminish.
 I am going to see the physician in a week and am going to mention the pains so I am curious as to her opinion.
 Also a note, I am still fertile and should not be prescribed this drug due to unkown pregnancy side effects- interesting that it was prescribed to me anyway.
 Doctor told me to go off of it if I wanted to get pregnant b."
tinnitus.
"heaviness in the legs, foot and leg cramps at night and even long muscles beside spine, those are the worst.
 rashes on forearms from sun sensitivity, scarred from itching and scabs (was taking St John's Wort for depression which also causes sun sensitivity, bad combination) cannot take at night or I'm up all night in bathroom.
 Less side effects from Lipitor than any other statin drug I've tried.
 Pravachol pushed cholesterol out my skin in boils.
 Lopids made me feel like I was coming down with the flu constantly, low grade fever and just felt sick all the time.
 Lipitor keeps me from getting sick, 3-4 days off of them and I'm up all night sick."
"Started 2 years ago with 10 mg then 6 mos later doc upped to 20.
 About 3 mos ago I had several severe left leg cramps-never had them before.
 Then about 2-3 weeks later, woke up and could barely stand and walk.
 Legs and toes were numb (worse in left), weak, back pain and calves hurt terribly.
 Walking was possible but only with intense effort and pain.
 Couldn't stand for more than 1 or 2 minutes-too painful and weak.
 Waited a couple 3 weeks to see if it would clear up-did not.
 Went to doc.
 Took x-rays said everything fine, blood test fine.
 Interested in doing MRI-thinking nacrotic nerve in lower spine.
 On an aside he said stop taking lipitor on an off chanch it may be an uncommon reaction.
 I started looking up lipitor reactions and came across so much info on side effects it was startling.
 I look back to about 1 1/2 years ago when I no longer had that special feeling that all males experience in my organ and a decreased sex drive (not typical for me).
 At the time I attributed it to male menopause-being around 54.
 I went to my accupuncturist and was told my chee was dry.
 Had 4 treatments over as many weeks.
 Started to see some improvement.
 At the onset of symptoms I felt like I would imagine someone that had MS would feel like, swaying, pulling myself up stairs, dragging legs.
 After having stopped lipitor and acupuncture treatments, I would say I am at about 50 or 55%.
 I hope I continue to keep getting better as this has really hit my life at a bad time.
 My cholesterol did go down but If I knew I would have these kinds of problems I would never have started taking the drug nor will I EVER AGAIN take it irregardless of my cholesterol level.
 I would recommend to those who have not had any lessening of symptons to try accupuncture.
 It can't hurt and may help!."
"I have been taking 20mg of lipitor for 1 year, It has lowered my cholestrol to 225 but I cannot deal with the agony of constant gas and loose stools.
 I am also experiencing heel pain.
 The loose stools and gas are more than I can bear.
 anyone switch to a different statin drug that did not cause loose stools and constant gas?."
"Within 7 days I had such severe myopathy (muscle pain) and cramping I could not walk, my CPK was elevated to that of a person having a heart attack and my liver enzymes were very elevated.
 I was on 10 mg and in."
"Lower back pain, stiff neck - could not turn head.
 Dr prescribed Lipitor.
 I took 20MG for 3 months.
 Had lower back pain so severe could hardly get out of bed.
 Ater getting up and moving around, pain would subside.
 Also started to have neck pain while turning head.
 Dr took a muscle injury test and results came back positive!
 Stopped taking Lipitor.
 After a few months, new muscle injury test came back negative.
 Neck pain went away within a few weeks.
 AFTER 1 YEAR BEING OFF LIPITOR I STILL HAVE THE LOWER BACK PAIN THAT FORCES ME TO WAKE UP AND GET OUT OF BED AFTER EXACTLY 7.5 HOURS OF SLEEP!
 Once I get up and move around, the pain disappears.
 If I lay down and take a nap in the afternoon, I don't have any back pain that wakes me up but once I lay down to sleep at night, 7.5 hours later I'm forced awake by the pain.
 I think it has something to do with the spinal disks expanding at night and by morning something that was damaged in that area by Lipitor kicks in pain.
 LIPITOR MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DAMAGE TO BODY TISSUES!
 PLEASE RESEARCH CAREFULLY B4 TAKING!."
"Sleeping all day and night - exhaustion.
 10mg started two weeks ago - have slept soundly 30 of the last 48 hours.
 But even when awake, feel exhausted.
 Can't continue this way.
 Will ask physician for alternative at next visit.
 Normally have high energy and sleep average of 6 to 7 hrs per day.
 Haven't been back yet for blood work to establish reduction numbers."
"After only 3 weeks on 10 mg of Lipitor I called my Dr to discontinue.
 I have recently begun a workout regimine 6 days a week doing elliptical training and weight training.
 After workouts I would be so tired to the point where I was going to bed at 8pm (I'm normally a night-owl).
 I was mostly feeling drained and tired which was unusual for me and didn't feel that way previous to taking the drug.
 I have also experienced tingling or a sense of my hand being asleep (example: if you lay on it wrong and it's numb-like).
 I have only been off one day.
 but have already slept better than I had in the 3 wks on it.
 Don't know if it worked to lower my cholesterol since I wasn't on it for the 6 wks to do the bloodwork.
 I am going to try to lower it naturally through exercise and diet instead of the drug.
 not sure it's worth the side effects.
 Stay in tune with your body.
 I elected to discontinue immediately with onset of side effects.
 Will consider other alternatives."
"Joint pain especially spine at 10mg.
 

 I had this reaction before but my doctor doubted it would be the lipitor.
 Stopped lipitor and symptems went away.
 Restarted lipitor at 5 mg and after 7 days seem to be having wicked joint pain again.
 Will stop lipitor again and see results.
 By the way 10 mg dropped my LDL to 77."
"rapid shallow breathing, fatigue, disorientation, slightly blurred vision, erectile disfunction, muscle pain.
 My GP and a respiratory specialist were totally unable to diagnose the problem.
 I tried stopping each med I was taking, some allergy/asthma stuff and Lipitor.
 All the symptoms largely disappeared after two days off Lipitor.
 Took months for lingering effects to clear completely.
 Anyone taking Lipitor and showing any undiagnosed symptoms, should be taken off Lipitor for awhile as a test."
"After about 4 years of taking Lipitor I started experiencing severe leg cramping at night with the pain traveling to my buddocks and stomach as well.
 The pain was so bad I could not get out of the bed and had to crawl to get to the bathroom to take Advil for the pain.
 I asked my doctor what could have caused this and he said it was probably from the Lipitor.
 Recently I experienced extreme stomach pain that stretched to my side and back.
 The stomach pain came suddenly and it would come and go for a week before it became so bad I could not sleep.
 I had just gotten over a urinery tract infection and I thought it had returned but the symptoms were different.
 I still had the urge to urinate constantly but it would come and go and I would have no symptoms for a day then it would return again.
 I remembered reading the phamplet that comes with the prescription drugs and it mentioning some of symptoms that I was experiencing.
 I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day and I did not have any mor.
 I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects.
 I don't want to be a case-study when they finally take this drug off the market."
"I'm not sure if this is related to the lipitor, but shortly after I started taking it, I exprienced complete paralysis in my forehead (peripheral neuropathy).
 Went to a neurologist,GP and ENT, none of whom have ever seen this kind of paralysis (both sides) with no other symptoms.
 Has any one else come across this symptom?
 I m tempted to go off the medicine to see if the paralysis goes away.
 It really lowered my cholestrol a lot, so I hope this problem isn;t related."
"Fuzzy thinking, blurred vision, muscle/foot pain.
 DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION.
 Look for natural remedies instead such as Red Yeast Rice supplements and eating healthier.
 Doctors should tell us about all the natural things to try first before turning to big drug companies!
 The drugs will kill you quicker than the original problem if you're not careful!."
"It made me extremely hyper, I could not do things fast enough.
 My doctor had me try it although my cholesterol level was only 205.
 I told her about my misgivings but she thought I would do ok on it.
 I even questioned her about the liver damage it can cause but she said it hardly ever happens.
 In less than two weeks I was so hyperactive I thought I was going crazy.
 I worked overnight at my job and I was trying to do things so fast that I would frustrate myself.
 My brain also felt like it was kicked into high gear as if I was on constant alert for something.
 I stopped taking Lipitor after two weeks and told my doctor.
 She said if it was the Lipitor she had never heard of that happening to anyone before and recommended I continue its' use.
 I stopped and now refuse to use it.
 At my last physical she said she was happy that I was so healthy.
 I exercise 5-7 days a week, lots of biking and running.
 EKG perfect, tri's were perfect, blood sugar perfect, etc My blood pressure is constantly around 106/72.
 My cholesterol was 212 so she tried to pu."
"51 yr old female.
 After 2 1/2 years on it (10 mg/day) I developed serious muscle pain and restlessness in my legs which made it almost impossible to sleep.
 Also, hot/cold fever-like sensations in the skin, but no fever.
 Constant sleepiness.
 I thought I had developed chronic fatigue syndrome and restless leg syndrome until I looked on the internet for Lipitor side effects.
 I am just glad I stopped taking it before permanent damage was done.
 Yes, it did a great job lowering my cholesterol, but the side effects are very dangerous and I would think long and hard before taking any statin.
 I would guess that many of our elderly relatives who seem to have cognitive impairments are really suffering from statin side effects.
 The drug companies have certainly done a number on the American public."
"I started taking Liptor as cholesterol was 494.
 After about 2 weeks I was extremely fatigued, headaches.
 After 2 months I started having leg cramps and very dark urine.
 Went in for 2 mo. blood test.

 Said it was compromising my liver.
 Had only taken my cholesterol down 30 points.

 Best blood tests ever,low dosage,felt great!
 Dec 2006,started mild diarrhea,maybe once every three weeks for a day or so.

 Right elbow just last week became very painful - joint pain.
 Also, started to have upper and lower back discomfort and trouble sleeping.
 Bloated and gassy.
 Blurred vision problems occasionally.
 I did not connect all the dots until I started searching the web for side effects.
 I'm seeing my doctor today and looking into natural cures - 3000 to 6000 mg.
 Vitamin C daily, Lysine, Vitamins A & E.
 Read about Dr Linus Pauling on-line and his findings about Vitamin C.
 He won a Nobel Prize for his research.
 Reduced choloesterol levels significantly but side effects are not worth it.
 I like to have a glass of wine with my dinner but with this drug, I'm concerned in addition to the side effects I've just started experiencing."
"severe overall body pain in every joint and muscle from my neck down to my big toes.
 Foggy brain, exhaustion, tingling in arms and hands, flu like symptoms, lack of energy, sensitivity to cold,.
 I started taking Lipitor about three weeks ago and felt the before mentioned symptoms almost immediately.
 At first I thought it was the stress of Christmas.
 However I did consider the side effects of Lipitor I read in other websites.
 I stopped taking Lipitor for about a week and felt somewhat better, Christmas over by then, once again I considered stress as the cause and not Lipitor.
 I went back on Lipitor about a week ago and feel horrible again.
 Found this website and no longer doubt the source of pain, etc is definitely from taking Lipitor.
 I am seeing my GP this afternoon and I am taking myself off this drug and will seek a natural method of lowering my cholesterol."

 Lipitor related symptoms (lack of enthusiasm, short term memory loss, muscle pain, bone/joint pain)are showing up (Liver Enzymes were OK in the last blood test, however).
 Metabolic syndrome is genetic, since my 8 and 4 year children tested with High LDL.
 Simply don't know what to do to bring LDL down.
 At this stage it is not clear what is better of the two evils: Lipitor or High LDL?
 And how to lower LDL without the side effects of statins?
 Vegetarian diet (approx. 5% saturated fat) and Exercise is already close to perfection based on the available information, but still left elevated LDL/HDL ratio to 5+ if not on Lipitor."
"1/7/05-Chest pain, general weakness, depression, anxiety, just not myself , insomnia, fatigue, memory problems, inability to concentrate.
 Doctors unable to connect the dots (Lipitor = above symptoms).
 Sure it lowered my cholesterol.
 But at what cost?
 I told my doctor I was feeling weak.
 He commented I see NO reason for you to be weak (Even though he prescribed the Lipitor for me)
 Well needless to say that was the last time I saw him.
 I thought I had MS,Lupus,Fibromyalgia or some other illness that has the symptoms I was experiencing.
 I found that Lipitor could be the reason for all of these symptoms.
 So, on my own, I stopped the Lipitor (I was only on 10mg per day)
 Within 48 hours I felt my mood elevating back to normal.
 So far (I've been off of it for about 5 days now), my chest pain has improved by about 75%.
 This is no coincidence I am certain.
 Hopefully my other symptoms of fatigue, anxiety, memory and insomnia will alleviate as well.
 By the way.
 my new doctor had prescribed an anti-depressent for me.
 I never filled it, as my instincts told me it was something more.
 I am generally a well balanced type of person.
 My depression did come on rather sudde."
"Gradual numbing of the feet over a period of a year.
 Started on Zocor and Insurance recommended switch to Lipitor and had gradual side effects.
 I'm back on Zocor and doing much better after a week.
 I would not recommend Lipitor."
"I was fine for 3 weeks and then it felt like a neo-nazi skinhead gang kicked me in the gut 150 times.
 I quit it and felt sore but better in a week."
"Severe Hip pain in both hips, calves are sore and tender to the touch, dramatically decreased libdo, eye sight changes.
 It did lower my CL."
"Muscle aches in arms and chest.
 It worked and got my cholestrol down to normal, a drop of 60 points in three months."
"Was on LIPITOR for 18 days.
 Developed sore legs, sore back, general tiredness and my head was foggy .
 making it difficult to concentrate.
 At day 16, developed excruciating toothache (that moved from day to day).
 Gave up on day 18.
 At end of day 19, the toothache had gone.
 I would not recommend this drug to anyone.
 My father-in-law was on the same drug to defeat cholesterol and ended up in a wheelchair with symptoms of Parkison's disease.
 He died of a massive heart attack last year."
"Stomach distress, gum trouble, muscle ache, eye trouble.
 I took the 10 milligram pills for almost fifteen years, experiencing stomach pains, abdominal bloating and other symptoms that I chalked off to a bad stomach.
 I had aches and stiffness in my hips and knees.
 When my doctor upped my dose to 40 mg, to treat aggressively a spike in my blood sugar, in three weeks I developed such severe stomach pain that I literally couldn't walk more than half a block without doubling over in agony.
 Unbelievable pain.
 Also, I was constipated, and I never am constipated.
 When I stopped takin it, the pains went away, including body aches and stiffness I had chalked up to aging."
"AFTER 2 WEEKS, I HAD SUCH PAIN IN MY KNEES, I COULD NOT EVEN GET OUT OF A CHAIR OR WALK ACROSS THE ROOM.
 I STOPPED AND WAITED FOR A MONTH AND TRIED AGAIN; THE SAME EFFECT ONLY WITHIN 48 HOURS.
 I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH 3 OTHER STATIN DRUGS.
 AFTER SEEING SO MUCH ABOUT THIS DRUG IN PERIODICALS AND SUCH, I WILL JUST HAVE TO TAKE MY CHANCES ON HEALTHY DIET; MY CHOLESTEROL IS MOSTLY GENETIC SO I AM STUCK UNTIL THEY COME OUT WITH A DRUG THAT DOES NOT CAUSE JOINT PAIN.
 ZETIA ONLY HELPS WITH FOOD INDUCED CHOLESTEROL SO IS OF NO USE TO ME.
 AND I REFUSE TO TAKE A PILL TO COUNTERACAT THE SIDE EFFECTS OF ANOTHER PILL.
 IT SEEMS THAT'S JUST WHAT THE FDA WANTS US TO DO."
"After taking lipitor for 1 week, my resting pulse jumped to between 100 and 105, and I started experiencing dizziness, lack of energy (tireness), and unexplained sweating.
 The doctor said these were not listed as known possible side effects.
 But after one (1) month my resting pulse had jumped to about 120 and the dizziness has become both more frequent and more pronounced.
 Have discontinued lipitor and will not take it for 1 month to see if symptoms disappear.
 Other symptoms which started occurring after a few days of lipiltor include sever leg muscle pain, swelling of the lower legs and feet, and even more sudden and pronounced sweating at random, unexplained times.
 My physical (6 days before starting the lipitor) was perfectly normal except for the cholestorol which had jumped from 175 to 220, primarily due to changed job/work conditions/diet/lack of exercise.
 Have appointment to see doctor again next week.
 And will discuss further with her.
 There has been some increase in jo.
 I discussed lipitor with two friends who are both teaching pharmacologists.
 BOTH had heard similar stories about lipitor and they had each heard of all of these symptoms being connected with it (FWIW, I have a large number of hypersensitivities to several other drugs [as well as to alcohol], so this was not a big surprise to me.)."
"I just took this drug (10mg)for the first time.
 After 2 hours I felt a warm sensation in my chest then pain then a headache.
 My Cholesterol level is 150.
 Why would my doctor recommend this drug?."
"insommnia, loss of dreaming, inability to visualize; muscle pain, weakness, atrophy; tendinitis, tendinopathy, tendon contracture; miniscus damage; working memory and short-term memory loss, language and learning ability loss including spoken and written aphasia and inability to read; gall bladder disease, pancreatitis, acid reflux; inability to walk.
 I kept taking myself off this drug, was told it COULD NOT BE TH E DRUG, urged to go back on, recovering somewhat each time, but finally the damage was not reversible.
 Today, I live with Lipitor and (other statins) injury which affects my ability to work, and I continue to try to recover.
 After long and only partial recovery from Lipitor I took two other statins with similar response.
 My cholesterol level is over 480.
 I have no cardiovascular disease, and see that according to this evidence based medicine source, there is NO evidence for statins in women for prevention.
 Do statins have a role in primary prevention?
 NO!
 http://www.ti.ubc.ca/pages/letter48.htm#comment
 A question to us about Letter #48: What is the evidence of benefit for primary prevention in women?
 There were 10,990 women in the primary prevention trials (28% of the total).
 Only coronary events were reported for women, but when these were pooled they were not reduced by statin therapy, RR 0.98 [0.85-1.12].
 Thus the coronary benefit in primary prevention trials appears to be limited to men, RR 0.74 [0.68-0.81], ARR 2.0%, NNT 50 for 3 to 5 years.

"I was started on 80 Lipitor, took it for 3 months.
 muscle weakness, legs felt like dropping off, muscle cramps, twitching, day and night.
 leathargy, was coming home from work so tired, would not eat going right to bed.
 pain in the back in shoulder muscles.
 Told my Dr about symptoms, hes idea was well we will lower it to about 20 Lipitor, I said no way.
 I am now on a low fat diet, and will loose about 25lbs, and use diet control, would never take another statin drug, It has taken about a month to feel good again."
"Just before this last Christmas I had a small stroke and spent three days in the hospital.
 To make a long story short, there are no after effects of the stroke.
 In other words the symptoms went away.
 But, my Doc put me on Aggrenox and 20mg of Lipitor.
 I have very high arches and have had a little tingling in my feet for years.
 This is really helped with a good arch support.
 But for the last two months the pain in my feet and calves (and sometimes thigh) has gotten much worse.
 I cannot walk very far and sleeping has become a problem because of the pain.
 Because of the preexisting arch problem, I thought it was just naturally getting worse but after finding this web site I am not sure if it is not the Lipitor.
 On a pain scale it has gone from a 1 or 2 to 7 or 8.
 I have a followup apointment with my Doctor in two days and was thinking of asking him if I could go off the Lipitor.
 What do you think? ."
"periodic achy muscles.
 20 mg.
 brought my counts way down."
"It did lower my cholesterol, but I became so depressed that I called my doctor and told her I refused to take it anymore.
 I think this effect may have been caused by an interaction with the birth control pill.
 it lowered my numbers, but made my life miserable."
"I added a rating about a month ago.
 At that time, I just stopped taking Lipitor after only three weeks because of the major side effects I experienced.
 Many of the side effects have lifted however I am still experiencing sore and stiff hips, knees, ankles and feet.
 I feel like the lower half of my body belongs to a much older person than me, I'm only 48 years old but feel 90.
 I am very concerned that I may have permanent damage done to my legs because of only three weeks on this drug.
 Is anyone else experiencing this lasting effect from Lipitor?."
"Alopecia, nausea, vomiting, severe back and hip pain, depression, dark thoughts, overwhelming exhaustion and muscle fatigue, sleeplessness, facial paralysis, loss of quality of life.
 Have been on Lipitor for approx.
 2 1/2 years.
 Within 5 months experienced alopecia, which I had never had before and excused as stress related.
 Nausea and vomiting began several months later, if taken within a 3-4 hours of eating.
 Then within a year of being on the medication, I experienced severe facial paralysis diagnosed as Bell's Palsey.
 Severe hip and back pain followed, along with depression, thoughts of suicide and paranoia.
 The overwhelming exhaustion that I felt every morning for over a year intensified.
 I have tried altering when I take Lipitor but it did not help with the nausea.
 I stopped taking the Lipitor 45 days ago after I began to experience hair loss again.
 I researched Lipitor in a pharmacy book and realized hair loss, along with most of my other ailments, were side effects.
 I started noticing improvement during the first 30 days.
 At 45 days, my facial paralysis is 99% gone, I wake rested, my back and hip pain are slowly improving and my overall mental wellbein."
"Debilitating muscle and joint pain, swelling of feet and hands, numbness and tingling in feet and hands, headaches, fatigue, blurred vision.
 Stopped taking it 7 days ago but the pain + other symptoms are not getting any better (all except blurred vison, that went away after 3 days off Lipitor).
 I am scared of permanet damage.
 I really really hope it is reversible, because I can't walk or do anything with my hands."
"Terrible, terrible, terrible charley horses in feet, calves, abdomen, breasts, shoulders and sides.
 Although my cholesterol was lowered rapidly, I have been taking 10mgs for about 5 year.
 I am so glad I hit upon this site because my doc hasn't paid any attention to my complaints of charley horses in my feet, legs, abdomen, breasts, shoulders, sides.
 Had brain scans for the memory loss, vertigo and headaches.
 Found some indications that I may have had mini-strokes over the years.
 Every time I laugh hearty , I get a breath-taking charley horse in one or both breasts.
 If I tuck something under my arm, I get a charley horse in my side.
 Charley horses in the abdomen while toileting.
 Charley horses in feet while driving.
 I am printing out this site and taking it to my doc.
 He has to pay attention now.
 Thanks to all of you for sharing."
"Constant heel pain, Possible cause of ulcerative colitis, but have no proof of this, and gastro/ent.
 Dr states Lipitor not likely cause, I believe otherwise.
 was on 10mg for 6 months,increased to 40mg for 6 months,reduced back to 10mg (because high CPK level)for rest of time taking med.
 Did not associate foot pain or colitis with statin until reading of others with similar problems.
 WILL NOT TAKE LIPITOR (OR ANY OTHER STATIN) ANYMORE!!."

 Changed to Zocor and things seem better.
 New discussion forum at http://angina.myfreeforum.org/ to discuss all issues related to this subject."
"I took it for about 8 years, starting at age 25, with no side effects (at least, nothing I attributed to the Lipitor).
 Went off on a couple occasions to have a baby then right back on.
 After 8 years, suddenly started having severe weaknesses in my legs, specifically thigh muscles felt like I had been trying to run marathons with no exertion.
 Went off Lipitor and pain went away.
 Now I'm on Crestor and just started having even worse side effects :o(.
 This medication DID help lower my cholesterol, I was close to 300 when I started it (and I did eat healthy and exercise moderately at the time, it's hereditary for me).
 and I was taking 40 mg.
 to get my cholesterol down around 200.
 My mother has taken it for even longer at max dose (80 mg) and has had no side effects she attributes to the medication.
 The bottom line is, listen and pay attention to your body.
 everyone's body is different and some people can't take the same thing!
 My brother also tried Lipitor and he couldn't tolerate it, it made him fall asleep!."
"insomnia, muscle aches.
 It's 1:00am, taking 10 mg, haven't slept in over a week.
 Plan to stop taking Lipitor tomorrow.
 It did lower my cholesterol tho."
"sleeplessness, peripheral neuropathy (tingling, numbness), bizarre muscular sensations, rash, itch.
 Effective at lowering cholesterol, but not without side effects.
 Do your research.
 Inform your GP as soon as you experience anything strange.
 This class of medication was most likely produced by a marketing department, rather than sound scientific study."
"My hair is getting very thin, after being on cholesterol lowering drugs for 20 yrs.
 Lipitor, for the last 8 yrs.
 Didn't know this was a side effect.
 Do all cholesterol lowering drugs cause hair loss?."
"Some added gas/wind.
 

 (Cont'd Pt.3) I've been on 80mg/day dose for one year+.
 I was more 'windy' but this seems to have subsided.
 I have no other side effects, but some fatique (I'm 57).
 I EAT ~NORMALLY~ folks!
 I eat a balanced diet - no sugar, butter or cream, rarely coffee, but gallons of English tea with skimmed milk - I do eat margarine, red meat (cut the fat off) 2-3 times per week, and some cheese.
 I drink maybe an average of 21 units of alcohol weekly (ale, red wine).
 I rarely exercise, am 5ft 11inches and weigh 12 stone 10lbs (or 178 lbs).
 I suggest getting your liver function test done with your cholesterol test every 6 months.
 Dr's are not Gods and they don't know everything - some don't know much at all - talk to the experts - cardiologists and heart consultants!!!
 Take everything with a pinch of salt; be healthily sceptical; go slowly and be wary, but don't cut your life short by raging against a drug that may be saving/e."
"zombie like tired depressed state,severe pain in calves total loss of support unable to walk,vertigo like attack, blured vision, no sex drive,decrease in balance.
 after going off it,significant spectacular improvement for 4 days on all symptons,slight continuing improvement in last 6 weeks, estimate 50 percent improvement over next 2 years,md's no help,act like they work for drug company not patient,this sight will save more lives and life than all statins combined,love your dotor, its just economic survival for him."
"9/20/05.
 I've been taking cholesterol lowering meds for at least 10 years including Mevacor, Zocor, Lipitor and Zetia.
 My cholesterol went from 398 to 260 on 40 Lipitor.
 This year I was given 80 mgs of Lipitor and Zetia was added as well.
 Along with the increased dosage, came crippling pain in my back, neck and then just my left foot, severe pain in my neck to the point where I couldn't hold it up without an effort, increased sinus pain, high blood pressure, insomina, blurred thinking.
 So to fix all these problems, I was given lots of other meds and tons of physical therapy and exercise each day.
 All so I could have great numbers.
 Finally, I realized enough was enough, I called the nurse practitioner to say I was stopping Lipitor and she was not really happy to put it mildly.
 I know my cholesterol will always be high, but after 2 weeks off Lipitor, I feel better each day and know it's not my age causing the pain, high blood pressure, memory loss, dizzines."
"I started experiencing severe leg cramping at night with the pain traveling to my buddocks and stomach as well.
 The pain was so bad I could not get out of the bed and had to crawl to get to the bathroom to take Advil.
 I asked my doctor what could have caused this and he said it was probably from the Lipitor.
 Recently I experienced extreme stomach pain that stretched to my side and back.
 The stomach pain came suddenly and it would come and go for a week before it became so bad I could not sleep.
 I had just gotten over a urinery tract infection (one of the side-effects) and I thought it had returned but the symptoms were different.
 I still had the urge to urinate constantly but it would come and go and I would have no symptoms for a day then it would return again.
 I remembered reading the phamplet that comes with the prescription drugs and it mentioning some of symptoms that I was experiencing.
 I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day and I did not have any more stomach pain or urgency.
 I also had been experiencing lack of energy for quite some time and I attributed this to stress but after reading this website I feel it was due to the Lipitor also.
 I don't think I will take this drug anymore and since I read that taking vitamin C can help you with your cholesterol I think I will try this method instead.
 I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects.
 I don't want to be a case-study when they finally take this drug off the market."
"Didn't think I was having side effects till I read here.
 I've been on it 4 years.
 Lowered my cholesterol from 248 to 150 within 3 months.
 Switched to Pravachol for 3 months due to insurance issues, and cholesterol went back up to 248!
 Switched back to Lipitor, and will have labs rechecked next week.
 Was controlled on 5mg/day only.
 I have several symptoms listed here, but not sure if related to the Lipitor, as I have other health issues (arthritis, fibromyalgia, plantar fasciitis) I do have slightly elevated liver enzymes (x18months), MD not sure if from Lipitor or 'fatty liver'.
 GI doc thinks Lipitor."
"I was taking this medication for 2 months.
 Intense pain in both calves and thighs when walking only a few blocks.
 Pain in lower back, forearms and left shoulder.
 I thought I was getting PAD.
 I couldn't climb stairs or walk while shopping with my wife.
 I needed to rest every few minutes.
 I don't even have high cholesterol, but my cardiologist suggested I take Lipitor as a preventitive treatment.
 I'm glad I found this site.
 I have stopped taking it for 3 days now, but pain persists."
"iritated eyes, extremely painful inflammed joints(too painful to walk) muscle cramps, numbness and tingling in feet arm and legs-muscle spasams in face and neck.
 regret ever taking this drug."
"OK for 4 years, then muscle cramps, spasms, weakness in legs and right hand progressed to atrophy.
 Foggy mental state, falling over,clumsiness,nightmares,dry mouth.
 Stopped taking Lipitor in April 2006 and rapidly improved, but a month later started going downhill again and have now been diagnosed with ALS.
 I am an unlikely candidate for MND.
 I know the Lipitor poisoned me.
 I wish I had stopped taking this poison before it caused permanent nerve damage."
"Took 10mg lipitor for 7 years had soreness of muscles for 4 years.
 Then started with excruciating pain and muscle cramps in lower back,then down left buttock, thigh,calf and ankle.
 Left foot has a numbness feeling to it,tingling in lower leg when walking,which I have to use a cane now.
 Also very fatiqued,buzzing in both ears, nausia, sleeplessness, gas and dark urine.
 All these side effect I have 24/7.
 I have asked my doctors more then once if any of my meds. could be causing me all this pain,3 different doctors said NO.
 They came up with, Arthritis,Tendonitis,Sciatica,after being checked out for all these, they were wrong.
 I stopped taking Lipitor and Tricor about 6 weeks ago."
"took Lipitor for over a year with no negative effects, then gradually developed terrible joint pain, couldn't move shoulders, hips hurt, had to push out of chair like old person.
 stopped taking it after almost 2 years; it really lowered cholesterol, but at cost of terrible joint pain, loss of sleep, shoulder and hip pain and loss of range of motion.
 Stopped, and pains lessened in one week; took months for it all to go away."
"Bloating - GI difficulties, added weight, weakened muscle noticed in arms but not legs.
 Prescribed 20 mg Lipitor for cholesterol.
 Took liver test (ok I guess - no response from doctor).
 Took 25 days and decided otherwise.
 Will go back to herbal and vitamin sources.
 Don't trust side effects especially memory difficulties and muscle-joint degeneration that some researchers say."
"On the third day taking just 5mg, stomach cramps and loose stools set in.
 Gas, bloating and fatigue followed.
 Just wanted to sleep.
 Couldn't exercise or eat.
 Started using anti-acids for the first time in 15 years.
 Three weeks after quitting the drug, the symptoms persist.
 I am 41, male, taking no meds (except 72 hours of Lipitor), with no history of smoking, diabetes, etc This drug (or class of drugs) is potentially very nasty."
"Massive hair loss, extreme joint stiffness (esp in my right knee - it would just lock-up), heart palpitations, heavy depression, skin and eyes swollen and itching.
 I have taken it for a long time and only in the last year have these symptoms occurred - perhaps these are long-term usage effects.
 I don't know why this drug is even being allowed to be sold!."
"I've been taking LIPITOR for a few years (had been on Baycol),.
 a couple of years ago, I began experiencing increasing joint and muscle pain that is now so severe that I am wodering if it's worth living with such pain.
 I'm very depressed.
 The pain is often so severe that it limits my ability to walk and climb stairs, to lift anything heavier than a few pounds.
 I've had some excruciating thigh cramps, and more recently, I have noticed a generalized weakness all over my body.
 It scares me to stop taking some statin drug because my cholesterol was very high without them, but my quality of life is so drastically affected that I think I have to.
 I believe it's very dangerous stuff."
"After taking drug for 10 days, I noticed a complete loss of taste for salt and sugars.
 Good food tasted bad or no taste at all.
 Taste perversion seems to be the term.
 Breathing air tastes sweet.
 It has taken 8 months for my taste to return to normal.
 Would not recommend it."
"Started out with fatigue/depression and was diagnosed with fibromalgia.
 Then came the extreme knee pain followed by hip pain.
 On top of this perpetual pain, I started having the irritable colon acompanied by three years of diarrhea that was diagnosed as colitis.
 I recently was totally dibilitated by swelling and pain in my hands.
 My family convince me to stop takng the Lipitor after my daughter found this site and after 4 DAYS - no swelling and the pain has subsided!!!
 I am interested in trying some of the natural options stated in this site to see if I can control my cholesterol (270 at the highest.
 Thanks to everyone who has enlighted me!!!.
 Time for the government to look into this drug.
 Don't you think it is interesting that the medical field has recommended that your cholesterol should now be 170 when just a few years ago 200 was good enough??!!
 Sounds as though the phamacuticals companies need to sell more statins."
"Sleeplessness, tingling in fingers.
 General foggy-headedness.
 Took the drug for several years before realizing that lipitor might be the cause of these symptoms.
 Stopped and started several times with recurring side-effects.
 Discontinued."

 Miracle drug- until year 3.
 Leg began having vibrating sensation (kept thinking cell phone was in pocket but it wasnt).
 Entire body ached; toes felt arthritic; had problems with memory & coordination (fell down stairs # of times).
 Stopped and all symptoms have gone away.
 Experienced same issue w/ all Statins- not just lipitor."
"The worst gas I've ever experienced!
 I mean smelly and painfull! Diarhea, headache, backache, runny nose.
 1 week on 40mg.
 Am stopping it now before anything else happens!.
 Why did my doctor start me on such a high dose?
 No warning of these side effects- I mean the gas and bloat is so bad I can't go to work."
lethargy and leg soreness.
"Muscle twitching, stiff neck, constant lightheadedness, always worrying about a brain tumor or something.
 I found this site and it looks like my problems may be the Lipitor.
 Doctor refering me to a nuerologist for twitching and light head.
 will ask about possibility of Lipitor.
 Lowered my Cholesterol from 255 to 173."
"Severe muscle pain and movement restriction, hand tremor, memory deficits, worsening cataract, gum infections.
 Improvements noted two weeks after discontinuing, did not regain full range of movements in arms for two years."
"Pain in shoulder and arms and hands.
 Hands are often numb and very weak especially in am.
 I thought it was carpal tunnel syndrome.
 Having difficulty opening jars.
 I ran marathons in 01, 02 and 03.
 and I have been a regular at the gym until about a year ago when I started lipitor.
 Recently, I noticed that I could not do a single push up without severe pain.
 Playing basketball has become impossible.
 Even a simple pass causes significant pain.
 The pain in my arms interrupts my sleep.
 I thought that I was just aging and/or out of shape, but it might be the lipitor.
 I am going off the medication and trying CoQ supplements and vitamin C to see if this helps."
"Muscle aches.
 Vision severe impairment in a.m.
 and pain and heaviness in eyes that were hard to open in morning felt like the eyes had blown up overnight.
 I did not want to get up in the morning because of the eye pain."
"general weakness, decreased stamina."
"Immediatly reduced my cholesterol.
 Over the 12 years my health has weakened in many ways that I noticed some of you other posters have mentioned.
 Is it because we are aging?
 Or the drug?
 Symptoms.
 here goes.
 Depression.
 Back surgery but the afterpain was unexplained?
 Maybe Lipitor?
 Hips are sore and lower back pain.
 Vision reduced greatly.
 Hair loss.
 Tired most of the time.
 Can't get to sleep and then can't get out of bed till late morning or midday.
 No strength.
 Loss of breath.
 So if a person goes off this, what is the drug alternative to keeping the cholesterol down?
 I am thinking of stopping the lipitor and going on a diet to prevent the cholesterol from rising.
 Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 Good luck to you all."
"Big problems with muscle cramps and numbness in my legs progressing to difficulty walking up stairs and swollen feet and ankles.
 Some of this could be other meds or combinations but I didn't have these problems before starting Lipitor.
 Statins are supposed to be the new miracle drug to keep us all alive for years longer.
 What a joke.
 Who would want to live like this?
 I have been off all my meds for about a week and feeling much better.
 I know it's dangerous but so are the drugs."
"general weakness, reduced stamina, tennis elbow in both hands.
 should only be taken by people with 300+ levels."
"SEVERE AND UNCHARACTERISTIC DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AGGRESSION, AND MOOD SWINGS.
 I cannot stress this enough- my personality comepletely changed after beginning this medication.
 I am typically an easy going, positively thinking, emotionally stable, and motivated person.
 But after starting Lipitor I've gradually descended into a world of extreme anxiety, hopelessness, lonliness, and self loathing.
 I've never in my life been so depressed, so obsessively focused on morbid, terrifying thoughts, or so negative about everything in my life.
 After being off of this medication for only 48 hours, I am already beginning to see an improvement in my moods, but this will be a long journey back to my old self, I feel.
 Oh yes, and I also suffered from: Gas, Constipation, EXTREME FATIGUE, weight gain and bloating, and occassional bouts of diaharrea.
 It lowered my cholesterol, to be sure.
 But it also significantly lowered my quality of life.
 This website has been an absolute lifeline for me.
 My doctor had seemed so completely unwilling to accept that my symptoms could've possibly been related to my taking Lipitor.
 However, I know my body and know when things are not as they should be.
 I have been feeling this way since almost immediately after I took my first dose.
 Hearing that so many other people have experienced the same exact symptoms as me has given me the courage needed to STOP this medication.
 So many of my family members and friends have had bad reactions to this stuff- I can not trust it, and will be looking for another way to get my cholesterol under control, if possible.
 Be very careful and very informed before you start any new medication.
 Don't always trust the word of your doctor as the only word and take it at its face value.
 When it comes to your body, you have every right to dictate, understand, and call the shots about what does and does not go in to it."
"Spleen Cancer and ALS patient.
 Took this drug for three years right after it was released -- bottom line lost all ability to control hands and muscle weakness.
 There is no history of ALS in my family.
 Currently being treated at Duke Medical Center."
Tingling all over my body and numbness.
"Having been on Lipitor for over one year, with a modest reduction in cholesterol levels, I developed a severe reaction following shoulder surgery.
 Approximately 4 months following my surgery, I developed an abrupt and chronic pain in my arms, hands and the back of my upper legs (from buttocks to knees).
 After two MRI's and EMG and blood and urine analyisis reviewed by a Neurologist with negative and/or normal results, I self-diagnosed having read numerous patient complaints mirroring my symptoms and reading a cautionary warning to physicians to consider taking their patients off Lipitor when the patient was scheduled for major surgery (www.drug.com).
 My Neurologist has prescribed Prednisone 10mg to help with the symptoms.
 I am trying to limit my use of the Predisone but cannot take care of basic functions without a minimum of 10mg daily.
 As a CEO of a large sales company and a physcially active person, I'm extremely concerned about this chronic condition.

 Muscle atrophy in left shoulder so bad that I cannot lift objects.
 Bad gas and constant diarrhea.
 Memory loss and difficulty concentratiing.
 These symptoms (except for the blind spot) manifested gradually after several years on Lipitor.
 I stopped 1 week ago, and the symptoms have seemed to stop worsening.
 I am hoping for the best, as my quality of life has suffered dramatically."
"muscle aches and weakness, nearly bed ridden over it and soon after they took me off I had a high sugar attack and have been on insalin ever since."

 TIREDNESS, DEPRESSED AS WELL."
"Extreme fatigue, muscle aches, cramps, MEMORY problems, balance problems, cold toes and feet (with NO circulatory problems) cold hands, dry throat/hoarseness, slurred speech.
 Lipitor works, but for me it was at a terrible cost to my quality of life.
 At first, I had no problems.
 Problems began gradually and I never put it together until my GYN said STOP taking Lipitor!
 Over this time, I gradually began to feel like an old, old lady and I was taking medication for arthritis and being tested for sorgren's syndrome.
 I was also joking about developing alzheimers but was really terrified of my memory problems and slurred speech!
 My internest never suggested it could be the lipitor.
 I've been off 1 month and it's been like waking up from a bad dream.
 Every day has been better.
 I hope it continues!!
 I took CoQ10 along with it.
 NEVER Again!!."
"Initially minor muscle pain but thought it was due to my working out.
 After two years of use - SEVERE muscle pain in sholder and hip joints - random fluish feeling (minor muscle achs all over)- random low energy.
 Within two weeks of this sudden increase in pain, I was waking me up at night in pain.
 Pain immediately declined within a few days of stopping lipitor.
 Won't touch it.
 I don't know how long it will take for my muscles to heal now."
"Intermittent temperature elevation, chronic diarrhea, and severe joint aches similar to abdominal flu symptoms.
 Lasted the duration of my Lipitor history (6 weeks).
 Of note is my history of cholecystectomy (10 years ago) and osteoarthritis."
"always feeling tired.
 high priced."
"Muscle tightness, cramping in legs and back.
 Problems sleeping and concentrating.
 felt like I had the flu much of the time.
 Irritable.
 I had no perceptable symptoms for about 6 months.
 Since this was the only medication I was taking, I quit it and started feeling better within a week.
 It took about 3-4 weeks to completely recover from this medicine .
 I tried other statins, but had similar bad side effects."
"sever muscle weakness with nerve damage,memory loss,red spots all over my body,hair loss,slowed speach,aphasia brain not sending messages to my muscles,shufflihg gait,unable to get out of chairs without help.

 I ask my Dr about my hairloss and spots on my body&was told [Your age]whenI lost my ability to walk very far I ask my pharmacist what drug if any would cause this she said stop the Lipitor and get to your Dr a.s.a.p.
 I stopped the drug 5weeks ago and have been in physcle therapy for almost 5wks with some help but the weakness comes & goes from one side to the other& back again .I have aphasia intermittingly, My eyes get blury My brain is going on overload right now so I pray that someway some how this killer drug gets off the market befor any more trusting souls get simptoms of unsuspected side effects.
 After reading all the side effects and looking back on all my proble."
"My chloresterol was 220 and my physician prescribed Lipitor.
 I took the medication for 3 weeks before I stopped.
 My left side, especially my shoulder and arm, are so sore and it's been a year since I stopped taking it.
 I'm concerned I have some kind of permanent damage to my muscles.
 I have no strength in my left arm and have a painful time lifting my own arm above my head and holding a hair dryer is a major task.
 My left hip hurts and I can no longer sit crosslegged on the floor.
 I am very limber but I cannot sit that way anymore and cannot get up from sitting on floor without a struggle.
 I wondered, at first, if I had some kind of mild stroke but found this website and realized I was right, it was the Lipitor.
 I lowered my chloresterol by eating a bowl of oatmeal at night, for me, just changing my diet was the trick."
"involuntary movements,muscles aches specially in back of legs, muscle weakness,, knee pain, neck pain,headaches,concentrating, blurred vision,back pain,difficulty to walk,I stop it since 10 days but i don t fell better do u know how long it take to be better?

"GRADUAL BUT SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SLEEP REQUIREMENT AND ENERGY LOSS,LOSS OF CALF SUPPORT IN LEGS,VERTIGO LIKE EPISODES,COMPLAINTS TO DOCTORS WERE TO NO AVAIL, CONVINCED ME IN ERROR.
 AFTER GOING OFF THAT GARBAGE WITH IN TEN DAYS SLEEP REQMT WENT FR 12 TO 7 HOURS, ENERGY LEVEL INCREASED DRAMATICALLY, LEG PAIN WENT AWAY, STRENGTH IS RETURNING, VERTIGO LIKE SYMPTONS DECREASING, LOOKING TO JOIN CLASS ACTION SUITE."
"Aches and pains everywhere.
 Gradually diminished mental acuity and felt depressed.
 Side effects came on slowly so I did not think it was the statin for quite a while.
 Bad side effects took about a week to 10 days to disappear after I stopped taking it.
 Will NEVER take another statin."
"No side effect for first 4 weeks, cholesterol down to 150 from 210, then unusual pain and weakness began in both legs, worse on left.
 Worse with exercise.
 Legs felt cramped and sore and weak, especially in calves and lower rear thigh muscles.
 I had been a regular and energetic walker, but I couldn't keep it up.
 My blood work showed mildly higher levels of whatever is watched for with this drug.
 The doctor left it up to me whether to continue, and I stopped taking it about 3 weeks ago.
 My leg pain seemed to improve after about a week but did not go away, and has now worsened again.
 I this drug should be used with far more caution!."
"Elevated CPK levels, muscle problems, felt bad.
 I landed up having to have a muscle biopsy to the right leg which showed no muscle damage, but elevated CPK levels still were present.
 After stopping this drug, the levels returned to normal after 3 months."
"fatigue,neuropathy, taste perversion, back pain,suicidal depression,weight loss, paranoia,general change in personality.
 Everything in my career and family life was going fine for me but a feeling of impending doom persisted in me.
 I do not think that enough long terms trials are done on this drug.
 Patients often struggle with its side effect and their experiences are not validated by physicians."
"Oddly, only positive.
 I seem to sleep better and have lots of interesting dreams.
 No adverse effects.
 Was on Niacin (500mg) for 90 days, but showed no improvement.
 Tried Tricor for about 8 days, but couldn't deal with the side-effects (sore joints, sleeplessness, gas).
 Been on 20mg Lipitor for 30 days now, but won't know any benefit for another 60 days."

 decreased immune system ,elevated wbc,s,trouble swallowing,hoarse voice,chest pain shortness of breath,decreased sense of smell and taste,irregular periods abnormal uterine bleeding , decreased progesterone production,dark urine,tooth decay,anxiety,anemia,back pain.
 I felt like I was being poisoned for the 3 years I was on it esp.
 the last several months after my dosage was increased to 40 mg.
 and I was being poisoned!!!
 by lipitor!!
 I have been off it now for 9 months and feel much better but still have residual side effects a constant vibrating down left leg, muscle and joint pain on and off still never got back all my smell and taste and still not making progestero.
 I have been a nurse for the past 25 years and have seen the devistation of these dangerous over perscribed drugs every day I go to work.
 The increase in kidney failure from patients on it the increase in infections ,auto immune diseases , and the over all ill health of these patients increased confusion muscle pain and weakness trouble walking increased bleeding in patients on statin drugs."
"Muscle weakness in arms and legs, blurry eyesight, hair loss, but worst of all, burning feet and painful heels.
 Taking the drug did lower my cholesterol and after 9 years my liver enzyme tests suddenly were in a good range.
 I believe a good diet can do more for me than Lipitor."
"Confusion, short term memory loss, lack of motivation.
 Returned to normal within a week of quitting Lipitor.
 I had rather risk living with a 228 cholesterol level than deal with the memory loss.
 It was quite frightening as it seemed like incipient dementia."
"Cognitive disfunction, neuropathy in my legs and hands, tinnitis, difficulty with speech, neck pain, extreme fatigue, muscle weakness and difficulty walking.
 I consider this to be an extremely dangerous drug.
 I can only hope that some day I will ever be able to lead a normal life again."
"extreme muscle and joint pain; extreme fatigue; muscle stiffness; tingling in feet, hands, and finally legs and arms as well; inability to walk any distance---felt like 90-year-old; contact pain where weight presses against things--bottom of feet, back of legs against a chair etc
 I complained to my doctor after just 3 weeks of 5 mg./day about muscle and joint pains.
 (I stopped the Lipitor myself after reading the label warnings.
 The pain stopped within days.)
 He checked the CK reading, which came back negeative.
 I used to work out at a gym for one hour twice a week, and he suggested that I was getting older and the workouts might be too extreme.
 I went back to taking the Lipitor and began cutting back on my exercise.
 After 6 months, in agony, I went for more blood work--everything was negative.
 After 9 months I stopped the Lipitor myself, but by then I was a mess: couldn't walk, couldn't lift my arms, horrible neck and muscle pain, horrible pain in every tendon in my body, particularly the Achilles tendon and those on the back of the head.
 My family doctor was at a loss.
 I went to a NY neurologist, then to a neuromuscular doctor who said it sounded like Lipitor, even though I had been off the Lipitor for almost 6 months.
 He suggested coenzymeQ10, 600 mg per day."
"I am 43 years old and have been taking Lipitor for a year and a half.
 I am having horrible aching in my fingers, knees, hips & toes.
 Went to my yearly exam this week and blood test reveals arthritis.
 No family history of arthritis, has to be the Lipitor.
 The drug did bring my cholesterol down over 100 points - but is it worth having arthritis to achieve that?."
"Some added gas/wind, otherwise I put down the extra tiredness due to my age of 57; I know I'm not 21 anymore!.
 Common sense here folks please; accept that everyone's different and drugs will affect us differently; put any chemical down your throat and you've got to accept that there could be consequences, sometimes not so good, sometimes awful - and sometimes blinkin' marvellous.
 Don't preach to others that this (or any other) is an evil drug; go slowly and carefully and get a second opinion if desired.
 Here are my experiences of taking Lipitor and Zocor statins over ~NEARLY 30 YEARS~!
 This length of time on statins has probably never even been logged before over such a long time.
 Thankfully statins have done me a POWER OF GOOD so far.
 High cholesterol is in my genes; it killed my dad died at age 58 when I was just 14.
 I'm now 57 (male) and hope to go on a bit longer :o) Note: I live in the UK and Europe has a different cholesterol measurement system of mmol/litre versus the USA system of mg/decilitre.
 Conversion rate: mmol/L x 38.5 = mg/dL.
 According to my 'GP' (Dr), th."
"Some added gas/wind.
 

 (Cont'd - Pt.4) , but don't cut your life short by raging against a drug that may be saving/extending lives of thousands like me."
Makes me very tired.
"Some addedd gas/wind.
 

 (Cont'd - Pt.2) According to my 'GP' (Dr), the UK male 'desireable target' is 5.1 mmol/litre or 196 mg/decilitre.
 Docs now actually like you to be lower than that if possible.
 In 1977 (at age 28) with a 'count' of 10mmol/L (385mg/dL), a VERY careful low-chol.
 diet made virtually NO difference to my count.
 So I went onto Zocor (new-ish then) and remained on it for 21 years, finally on a dose of 40mg/day with no real side effects - it lowered my count to 5.6mmol/L.
 As my count started to rise again to 7.8 in 1997 (at age 48), I switched to Lipitor, starting with 20mg/day and then 40mg/day which dropped my count A LOT to just 5.1mmol/L and with an HDL 'good cholesterol' count of 1.6.
 After a 3-week holiday without pills, my count rose to 10.4, so I went back onto 40mg/day of Lipitor - but my count was still only 6.7, so I put myself onto 80mg/day Lipitor and my count went down to 5.5 - this is the highest dose recommended.
 I've been on this."
"I have been on this medicine for about 8 years.
 Reduce my cholesterol level for 8.6 to 4.8 over a 3 month period.
 This has meant that I can eat and live a normal life.
 Over time however I have noticed the occassional muscle soreness, lower back pain and now a pain in my left hip.
 The hip pain is a muscle that continually knots up and often needs physiotheraphy to fix it.
 Over the last few years years 6 - 8 of using this product I have noticed that from time to time I suffer from unusual amount of vagueness, short term memory loss and shortness of breath.
 The muscle pain keeps me awake at night and life is just a pain, but I must point out I am not feel depressed about it at all.
 I just get on with life and try to manage the muscle pains.
 I am today a bit concerned after being feeling strange for about the last 3 week, by strange I mean daily events of vagues, loss of short term memory, head aches and shortness of breath so I when to see the doctor and he suggested I stop taking the med.
 Worked well for the first 5 years but cholesterol seems to have creeped up a bit from 4.4 to 5.3 over years 6, 7 & 8."
"Developed severn calf cramps after a couple of weeks on Lipitor where I could bearly walk and after talking to a friend he told me he was prescribed Lipitor and had developed leg cramps and his doctor switched drugs.
 Before taking Lipitor I never have leg cramps.
 I then called my doctor and told him about my leg cramps and told me to stop taking the Lipitor and he was going to prescribe another drug.
 After one week off the drug I still have severn leg cramps and went in for another doctors visit and he said he didn't thiink it was a Lipitor side effect because the cramps were localized and felt maybe the cramps were caused by a muscle enemze.
 He drew blood and is running tests.
 About the same time I got the leg cramps my right knee swelled up so I saw another doctor and I don't know if the knee and leg cramps are related side effects.
 Anyway I asked the second doctor about Liptior side effects re. leg cramps and he felt that the side effect could be localized and that the cramps could.
 After learning about the side effects of Liptior and talking to several people who have been prescribed Lipitor all had some kind of side effects."
"Jaw,neck, low back and hip pains.
 Numbness/tingling in legs and arms.
 Dr changed first to Vytorin then Pravachol.
 Took about a month for the same symptoms to begin with Vytorin.
 The pravachol started the pains again in about 3 months.
 I stopped taking all statin drungs.
 Still hurting after 2 months of stopping.
 Be careful taking this drug."
"Experiencing fatigue, lightheaded and weakness.
 Hip, back and leg pain.
 Along with a tennis elbow type pain that runs down into my hand.
 I also have neurally mediated hypotension and since I have been taking lipitor I have had recurring fainting spells."
"I experienced tighening of the chest and leg cramps.
 I really didn't have a bad reaction to this Medicatiion.
 I would take this medicine over Niaspan anyday!."
"Took 10mg lipitor for approximately one year.
 Experienced lethargy, tingling in arms, trouble sleeping, irritability, anxiety, mild depression.
 Finally went off all statins when I experienced a particularly bad reaction when the doctor, with a gleam in his eye, recommended combining lipitor with Zetia.
 The results were so bad in terms of side-effects that I ceased all statins and discontinued the Zetia in short order.
 I now take no statins, no Zetia.
 Individually they have their own problems; combined they are extremely dangerous and, in my opinion, should be banned as a combination therapy.
 Probably safe in short doses, a very bad candidate for long-term use unless closely monitored and used in lowest possible safe doseage.
 Would warn other patients to NOT COMBINE LIPITOR OR OTHER STATIN WITH Zetia, a common tactic that you will most likely regret.
 Let the pharmaceutical reps take the meds they peddle and get them off the street, instead of handing out free clocks, watches, and vacations to cowboy-style doctors who are little less than drug-pushers."
"After about 10 weeks on Lipitor I suddenly developed pain/cramps in both my legs, the left being slightly worse than the right.
 The cramps and tightness was sporatic from ankles, to calf to top of thigh then back of thigh, it didn't make sense as I hadn't done anything out of the ordinary to be feeling this way and it felt different than a overworked muscle type of pain.
 Although the Lipitor brought my level from 206 down to 143 within 6 weeks from what I have been reading I don't think I will begin taking it again.
 I stopped about a week ago, although my Dr didn't think that was the cause, however, nothing else made sense.
 The pain/tightness is somewhat better than it was 3 weeks ago, but still giving me problems."
"If you are having muscle aches and pains, weakness, exercise intolerance, neuropathy, etc etc, please stop taking this drug.

"Excruciating pain in right buttock.
 Unable to get out of bed, to walk, or to sit without extreme discomfort.
 Pain and stiffness spread to other side.
 On painkillers around the clock.
 After fifth week of misery, found this site and immediately stopped taking Lipitor.
 Waiting for improvement."
"The most terrible muscle spasms in legs,back and chest, so bad I could not sit or stand.
 Nausea, vomiting, chest pain,blood in urine, side effects were so bad I ended up in the emergency room on two occasions.
 The last time I was on vacation and was brought to the hospital where the Doctor took a blood and urine test and told me that the pain was from the lipitor.
 Never take this horrible drug , I don't know if it has caused permanent damage.
 but the side effects alone will make you get off the drug."
"pain in shoulder and arm, could not lift arm and had only been taking for 2 weeks.
 Could not sleep because of pain!.
 Don't recommend at all.
 I recommend omega 3 and coq10.
 cholesterol levels went down 100 points with that alone.
 finally 4 months later my pain has subsided."
"Muscle weakness and extreme pain, nausea, diarrhea, dark urine, dizziness.
 I have been off of it for 4 days and can barely walk.
 I hope that this is not permanent.
 I thought that I had the flu bug tht was going around the neighborhood.
 I had taken pravochol for years with not side effects, but wasn't lowering my cholesterol enough."
"For some reason the doctor started me on 40 mg/day after years of unsatisfactory results with provachol.
 Flu like synptoms started immediately-then numbness in my shoulder, gas, headaches,diarhhea, dark urine them debilitating joint and muscle pain.
 I can barely walk-took for only 10 days.
 Have been off for 4 days with no improvement-I am terrified.
 Went to the doctor and he did no additional tests - just said to stay off lipitor.
 When I asked if I would feel better-he just said he hoped so-what is that supposed to mean??
 Has anyone had any advice from their doctor on how to reverse these effects?.
 I WOULD NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE-WOULD RATHER DIE OF HEART ATTACK THAN FEEL LIKE THIS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE."
"My mom is taking lipitor 10mg .
 SHE is 71 years old was a active lady.
 She would walk and exercise daily.
 After takeing this medication she is now walking with a cane .
 And has server pain all over her body."
"HORRIBLE muscle pains, horrible back spasms,spasms in leg muscles, nausea, vomiting, pain so bad that I could hardly walk or sit.
 chest pains, so bad that I ended up in the emergency room 2x not knowing what it was from.
 One Doctor finally took a blood test and told me it was from the lipitor.
 

 NEVER NEVER TAKE THIS DRUG.
 I am hoping that I did not hurt myself permanently by taking it.
 don't know what to do to find out ."
"Terrible short term memory problems, lack of motivation, weak and wobbly unbalanced feeling (walked like a 90 year old), not sure footed as I walked, overall weak feeling, difficulty driving due to muscle function irregularities, tightness in throat with occasional choking problem, lightheaded foggy brain (like being in a stupor), loss of endurance, heavy legs and arms, eye muscle spasms, dizziness (vertigo), lousy sleeping at night, terrible concentration, bad dreams nightly, foot and leg cramps especially at night in bed, always exhausted, hip joint pain, muscular aches, swallowing problems, hard to get out of bed in the morning, constant muscle tension in legs (inflexibility), sadness, mood swings, loss of muscle mass in chest and arms.
 I took 10 mg/day of Lipitor for 6 years.
 It worked perfectly and made my blood test numbers for cholesterol, HDL/LDL and Triglycerides look textbook perfect.
 A few of the symptoms I listed (mostly muscular) quickly appeared when I began the Lipitor and became slowly more intense and more of them came into the picture as each year passed.
 I stopped the Lipitor recently out of desperation and most all symptoms improved greatly within days of stopping.
 I do not plan to resume it and will find some other way to control things."
"extreme disabling vertigo,loss of support in all muscels in particular calf and leg,excruciatig pain if try to use muscels confined to bed for 2 weeks unable to leave,loss of sex drive,hair,memory loss,extreme fatigue no mater how much i slept,partial tempoary loss of sight one eye,hardest on legs,calfs,and to lesser extent sholders.
 for me it was a posion,dr did not follow phizer advise,should have taken me off drug a year before due to my complaints instead of blaming it on my age.
 doctor did not test enzimes or sedementation rate.
 sedimentation rate important norm 1 to 20 mine was several hundred or more.
 been off drug for almost 5 months muscel pain is gone strength has recovered to 25 percent of normal,fatigue and vertigo have lifted,cq10 may have helped.
 plus saw palmetto,fish oils ,south beach diet,hydration but stil a long way from all clear,mental strength improving first,but body is still racked,depression has left but still resting when i can and still feeling extremely vulnerable."
"Extreme muscle problems and joint pain.
 In only one day of taking lipitor I nearly died.
 I was 45 years old when I took lipitor.
 Terrible mistake.
 My son almost died after taking lipitor for two months.
 His liver was functioning at only 50% and he was saved by being admitted into the hospital for 3 days.
 His cholestrol went up dramatically not down."
"Severe muscle pain in calves, unable to run at all even though I've been running marathons all my life.
 Felt very unwell, as though I had a high temperature.
 My total cholesterol did drop from 6.5 mmol/l to 3.6 but my HDL also dropped to below 1 mmol/l actually making my good/bad cholesterol ratio worse.
 Because I felt so ill, I stopped taking it.
 Cholesterol went up almost immediately after stopping Lipitor and I felt great again and was able to run again.
 A year later I tried Lipitor again with the same side effects as before.
 I stopped taking it and decided to live with high cholesterol as taking this drug made my life not worth living."
"I am left with chest pain, muscle weakness and spasms and I am up every 3 hrs drinking water.
 Drs. laugh when I say that I have Rhabdomyolosis - my Cpk or ck or whatever it is is fine.
 but no one cks the myoglobin or hemoglogin in urine.
 I'm desparate for a Dr in Mn. that will do that.
 I don't know where to turn and get sicker and sicker.
 Am afraid my heart will go.
 The drug gets cholestorel down, but ruins your life."
"Severe muscle and joint pain in left leg.
 My cardiologist started with a dosage of 80 mg which seems very high.
 Symptoms started after second dose.
 After third dose pain was so severe I could hardly move.
 I stopped Lipitor.
 The doctor recommended laying off Lipitor for a week and then restarting.
 NO WAY!
 The pain has gradually subsided but it has not disappeared over a period of several months.
 This stuff is poison.
 I would rather take my chances of a heart attack than live with Lipitor.
 I experienced weight gain because my level of activity has dropped."
"very persistent dry skin spots especially on my legs.
 Some leg pains at first, reduced with time.
 small amounts of gas, but almost constantly."
"I experienced lightheadedness, depression, short term memory problems.
 The worst side effects by far were the severe muscle pains and cramps, especially in my shins, front of my thighs, feet and hands.
 I noticed that they usually began about an hour after taking the Lipitor and would continue for several hours into the night.
 I was on Lipitor 2 years when I noticed that on a day that I had forgotten to take it, that I didn't experience the severe pains.
 I experimented by taking the medication one night and then not taking it the next.
 Sure enough, every night I took the medication I had the severe cramps/pains but the nights I didn't take it, either I didn't experience the pain at all or it was at a much lesser degree.
 After a few days, I stopped taking Lipitor for a 2 week period and noticed that all my symptoms improved and the muscle pains and cramps completely resolved.
 I notified my doctor.
 She stopped the Lipitor and suggested that I try Red Yeast Rice instead.
 It has given good results with no side effects."
"WEAK MUSCLES ,POOR BALANCE,VERY VERY TIRED CAN'T WORK MORE THAN 2 HOURS WITHOUT A NAP."
"taking lipitor for 1 year.
 four months ago I noticed it was difficult for me to get out of bed.
 the stiffnes and pain in my right hip got worse.
 difficult for me to walk down the stairs when I first get up.
 i feel like something in my body is going to crack if I move the wrong way.
 last 3 weeks symptoms are getting worse.
 after sitting fo a while, it is difficult to stand up.
 very tired and sometimes legs are restless during the night.
 I thought I was going crazy or had MS or worse.
 Bless you for this web site.
 I stopped taking Lipitor on my own but did let my doctor know.
 I will seek alternative treatment.
 I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
"Taking it for a little over a year and have had many of the side effects to some degree.
 Gas, bloating.
 sleeplesness along with fatigue and not being able to get out of bed in the morning.
 The worst is muscle stiffness and not being able to walk at times.
 I am feeling like an old lady and I'm only 54 and blamed all this on menopause or arthritis.
 Difficult to walk up and down the steps especially in the morning.
 I just stopped taking lipitor and after this experience I WILL adjust my diet and I just joined the gym again.
 I am taking some herbs to detox my system and in a month,I will begin alternative treatment.
 I was also starting to become depressed.
 Good Luck to all of you.
 Will keep all of you in my prayers."
"muscle and joint pains--particularly severe at night--lasting even after stopping medication, although decreasing in severity.
 I'm distressed that pain continues even after stopping the medication.
 I took the medication for 9 months (my doctor said the pains weren't from the Lipitor because there was no indication in the blood work)--finally stopped when could barely walk.
 I've been off the medicine for 2 months and pain is less, but still very present, especially in joints."
"After only 2 1/2 weeks on Lipitor I could feel that something was not right in my body.
 Extreme headaches, severe neck pain, fatigue, sore muscles and joints, fevers, chills, sweating, dark urine, flu like symptoms, swelling of right knee, irritable, just wanted to sleep all of the time.
 Called my Doctor and told him about my symptoms.
 He said it sounded like I had a virus.
 He told me to go off lipitor for two weeks and then try it again.
 I have no intention of taking lipitor again.
 Just now starting to feel somewhat normal again after being off it for one week.
 However, I have now developed a sore throat."
"Severe achilles tendonitis in both legs, heel pain, burning sensations in calves-maybe Lipitor is why?
 I have spent almost a year with this problem and spent 4 months in physical therapy-I am calling my doctor and getting off this drug immediately!!!!
 Even if it is not the culprit, I can't take the chance."
"dizzyness, coninuing and increasing weakness (especially legs), aches & pains, loss of coherent thought, memory loss, wildly varying blood pressure, syptoms similar to TIA's.
 After 2 years on this drug I seriously felt life was not worth living.
 Started Lipitor when recovering from major surgery, and attributed effects to that; but after initial uphill recovery, went downhill at an expotential rate.
 Two days after stopping, myself and my family noticed the difference - now 3 weeks have passed and have not had any of the above symptons.
 Now just want to find someway to help recovery from Lipitor damage."
"Started taking Lipitor 3 months ago.
 Have experiences significant weight gain even though I have been following a low caloric diet.
 Also have experienced fatigue, sleepless nights, bouts of constipation and diarria.
 Have also had muscle pain especially in the leg/calf area and the lower back.
 Originaly thought that the pain might be caused from a slip disc that I have, but the pain is different than experienced before.
 After reading all the ratings on thib web site I'm convinced that the new pain/weight gain/fatigue and general not feeling."
"Joint pain, back and shoulder pain, arm pain, numbness and tingling in the hands.
 Edema of hands and ankles.
 Blurred vision and memory loss.
 Arthritic type pain in all joints.
 I could barely get out of bed in the morning or walk up stairs.
 I was depressed that.
 I realized that I felt better in the late afternoon and evening.
 I had been taking the Lipitor at night.
 Therefore, I knew that its effects were wearing off at that time.
 I've stopped it for 3 days and feel 100% better.
 Very scary drug."
"Lethargy, fuzzy thinking, blurry vision, dull muscle pains constantly.
 It has done almost nothing for my Triglycerides, nor has it elevated my HDL.
 My LDL and total Cholesteral, however responded quite favorably.
 Make sure you don't take Lopid with this.
 It can damage your heart and keep you short of breath and constantly weak."
"LIGHT HEADED, INCREASED BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART THROBBING OUT OF MY CHEST, TINGLING IN MUSCLES OF UPPER TORSO.
 MY SCAPULA AND SHOULDERS FELT LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING VIBRATING UNDER MY SKIN.
 HEADACHES.
 AND FEELING OF DOOM.
 THOUGHT I WAS HAVING A HEART ATTACH WENT TO E/R TO RULE OUT.
 I STILL HAVE THE MEDICATION IN MY SYSTEM AND WILL FIND OTHER ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS WT.
 LOSS, DIET, AND EXERCIZE.
 I WILL JUST HAVE TO SAY NO TO WHIPPED CREAM.
 I RATHER GIVE UP SOMETHING I LOVE THEN TO TAKE THIS MEDICATION AGAIN."
"headache, chestpain, arrythmia, diarrhea, malaisse, forgetfulness, confusion, back pain and after 1 month a worrisome case of phlebitis(every superficial vein in my one leg is bulging) my veins hurt, severe leg cramps, numbness in ankles and toes.
 I stopped this statin on july 26th.
 I have been told it will take at least 3 months for this medication to flush from my system.
 will have a blood test next week.
 I take norvasc with no problems.
 Am not a big supporter of meds.
 Let me tell you, this lipitor is dangerous and life threatening.
 Somewhere in the future this will be another vioxx.
 I will never take any cholesterol lowering meds again, statin or otherwise.
 Have not been able to use my treadmill for a month due to phlebitis.
 I refuse to be a guinea pig for any statin drugs.
 will continue on a balanced diet and exercise.
 I was an active, energetic 76 yr old.
 treadmill 5 x's a week for 35 minutes at 3.8 miles per hour.
 took zetia 5 mgs(i cut the pill in half because i was afraid) afterstopping the lipitor experience.
 zetia gave me chest tightness, headache."
"Joint pain, muscle ache, fatigue.
 While doctors will test your liver function on this medication, and they may run a blood test to check for muscle wasting, many doctors deny that there is a connection between joint pain, muscle aching, fatigue etc and Lipitor.
 I stopped taking the medication and the symptoms gradually dissipated.
 About a year later, I was put on it again and once again the same symptoms returned.
 I saw another doctor and this physician is the one that stated that Lipitor is more than likely the cause.
 Another family member was on Lipitor and experienced very similar symptoms.
 She took herself off of the medication her symptoms also began to fade.
 She demanded to be put on another medication and was.
 Not all people who take Lipitor will have adverse reactions, but if you do experience these symptoms, don't just accept your doctor's denial of a connection between the two.
 You may want to get a second opinion."
"cognitive ability deminished.
 My recall was slower and not uncommon to not be able to process thoughts.
 The best way to describe it would be to say that I notice that I am not as smart as I use to be.
 I no longer take it and I am smarter.
 I was only taking 20 mg a day."
"10mg/day for 6 years, no side effects.
 Recemt increase to 20mg/day caused severe pain in back, hips, legs, and feet.
 Unable to walk or stand for more than 10 minutes.
 To lower cholesterol, excercise is necessary.
 With Lipitor, it's impossible for me to even walk slowly, so what point is there in taking Lipitor?
 I stopped, MD wants me to try other statins.
 I have my doubts about all of them."
"muscle weakness in ankle, plantar muscle, back.
 I stopped lipitor right away when a friend told me that her supposedly 'fibromyalgia' disappeared when she stopped the drugs.
 Too many people with disabilitating symptoms taking lipitor or all the other cholesterol prescribed drugs.
 It did lower my cholesterol but I don't need to be cripple.
 Now I eat soaked oatmeal, 1 glass or dry red wine x4 weekly, watch my diet, walk 1/2 hour daily.
 It does lower my cholesterol from 300 to 175 I stopped it for 1 month my cholesterol went up again.
 I suggest people with high cholesterol to research more about all cholesterol lowering drugs.
 They all have the same formula with different names.
 Find alternatives like me.
 go natural."
"Depression, anxiety, spaced-out feeling, lack of concentration, insomnia.
 I take zoloft for major depression and it works well.
 However, within days of starting lipitor, I started feeling the adverse side effects Depression, anxiety, spaced-out feeling, lack of concentration, insomnia which are pretty much how I felt when I was experiencing major depression.
 The thing is, if I were to stop taking zoloft today, it would be months before I felt the depression returning, and it would take months to get back to normal when I restarted zoloft.
 Lipitor put me in that state in a could of weeks, and after stopping lipitor, I was feeling better in a few days.
 Just to be sure, I started taking lipitor a second time, and the depression came back within one or two days.
 It's now a week since I stopped it and I'm just now getting back to normal.
 I haven't noticed any increased muscle or joint pain.
 I'm not touching statins again."
"Shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle soreness, numbness in arms, constant headaches, impending doom, short-term memory loss, flu-like symptoms.
 Thank you for this website.
 I have been looking for reasons why I feel this way and have started medical 101.
 Tomorrow am scheduled for lung scan and chest x-ray and Dr game me # for cardiac CT scan after that.
 I want to cancel all appointments and stop taking Lovastatin.
 Being taking 40mg for 4 months now and symptoms began immediately with shortness of breath.
 The muscle soreness and headaches will not go away and I feel like I got hit by a truck.
 Will be going off it though it did lower my cholesterol.
 I am an otherwise healthy woman who exercises 3 times a week (walking and swimming laps)and am lacto-ovo vegetarian.
 Again, thank you for this website.
 It took a fews weeks to find it through my searching.
 I definitely will bookmark it."
"Due to bad family history and some early calcification, taking 10 mg at bed time quickly lowered total cholesterol to new target well under 200.
 After taking it for 8 months developed widespread muscle pain - neck, back, hips, legs, and hands.
 Aches and pains interupt sleep.
 Very stiff upon waking and hands hurt so much can't make a fist.
 Weakness when standing after sitting.
 Early in the day I move like someone much older.
 Pain diminishes throughout the day.
 lst doctor said probably had arthritis but could not explain overnight appearance or widespread discomfort.
 Second doctor said has been seeing lots of patients who have similar problem with statins and blood tests not confirming inflamation.
 Has suggested I stop taking for around 3 months to see if symptons go away.
 If pain disappears will try another statin.
 Also taking Fosamax 35."
"Some muscle soreness, but tolerable.
 However weight gain has been a problem.
 Several friends mentioned the same weight gain problem."
"DIZZY, BALANCE, HIGHER BLOOD SUGARS, CARPAL TUNNAL, CRAMPS, JOINT PAIN, MEMORY LOSS, KIDNEY PROBLEMS.
 I STARTED ON ZOCOR AND CHANGED TO LIPITOR AFTER 1 YEAR BECAUSE OF BALANCE PROBLEMS.
 AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS I BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE BALANCE PROBLEMS AND JOINT PAIN, BUT THE DOCTOR DID NOT THINK THAT LIPITOR WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEMS.
 BECAUSE OF HEART DISEASE THE DOCTOR WANTED MY CHOLESTEROL DOWN TO 150 IT WAS AROUND 200.
 HE PRESCRIBED 40 MG OF LIPITOR FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND EVENTUALLY ADDED GEMFIBROSIL, AND NIACIN BECAUSE OF HIGH TRIGLYCERIDES.
 AFTER A YEAR OF TAKING THESE DRUGS, MY TYPE II DIABETES BECAME UNCONTROLLED AND MY KIDNEY READINGS BECAME BAD.
 I WAS THEN PUT ON INSULIN.
 I BEGAN TO DEVELOP JOINT PAIN AND NEUROPATHY.
 THE PAIN IN MY HANDS BECAME SO BAD THAT I HAD TO HAVE CARPAL TUNNAL SURGERY.
 I COULD NOT WALK WITHOUT FALLING.
 I FINALLY BECAME SO DEBILITATED THAT I HAD TO RETIRE EARLY.
 THE DOCTORS TOOK ME OFF THE LIPITOR AFTER THE KIDNEY READINGS BECAME SO HIGH.
 HOWEVER THEY DID TRY TO PUT ME BACK ON THEM SEVERAL TIMES.
 I HAVE BEEN OFF STATIN DRUGS FOR FOUR YEARS AND I HAV."
"Where to begin?
 Overall fatigue.
 Now get a lot of sinus colds(major pressure pain).
 Also used to be able to walk 3 miles easily.
 Now cant walk 50 ft without feeling like I am having a heart attack.
 Nausea.
 I was on Lipitor of a total of 3 weeks before I had my first chest pain walking to car.
 Now a month off the drug I still have the pain."
"Muscle Pain,esp calve muscles, knee pain, neck pain, dizziness? vagueness, dry eyes.
 Works well at lowering cholesterol, BUT, at the expense of muscle pain, & general degradation."
"I have Rhuematoid Arthritis for 35 yrs and have been on many arthritis meds.
 I currently am on Relefen for inflamation, Prednisone 5mg, every other day and Enbrel injections once a week.
 I have no problems from these drugs.
 Eight mos. ago another doctor put me on Lipitor 10mg daily because my chol was 240.
 Over a period of 6 mos., it went down to 159, which was great, BUT I started having terrible aching pain in my arms about that time which was radiating down my arms from my shoulder to my hands and I could not sleep well at all.
 I lost all the strength in my muscles and was fatigued all the time.
 I was blaming my arthritis for my pain for months and months.
 I started taking extra Relefen and Prednisone which helped only temporarly.
 I could hardly lift a glass of milk without using both hands, I was so weak in my arms and hands.
 One day it just hit me.
 Maybe it's the Lipitor .
 It was the newest drug I was taking.
 So, I just quit taking it and within 3 days my arm.
 I suggest anyone who develops a bad symption within a week or month of going on Lipitor, or any other statin drug, quit taking it and call your doctor.
 There are some important reasons why some people HAVE to be on a statin in some cases."
"elevated CPK in the 250 range.
 I have been of Lipitor of 15 months and my CPK is still elevated.
 Three doctors have agreed that it is/was caused by lipitor.
 Does anyone have info?????."
"Depression,muscle pain,night sweats,lack of concentration,SUPER dry skin.
 bla,bla,bla.
 all the bad stuff you have read so far.
 Here is my stupid joke when talking to my friends.
 Yeah I have ALS, MS, Lupus, Lyme Disease, Fibromyalgia and one more thing, aaaa aaaaa what's it called?
 Oh yeah, Hyprochondria!
 I have been off it for 8 weeks and still hurt.
 I cant believe how many people have felt the same way and thought the same things I did!
 This is POSION, POSION I tell you!
 Stupid doctor says learn to deal with pain.
 That is just unacceptable!
 I have been on and off all the statins for about 3 years, off forever now that I know I don't really have some terrible disease!."
"Severe muscle pain.
 Severe knee and back pain.
 Several doctors suggested knee surgery.
 I went off Lipitor and knees are fine, muscle pain dissapeared.
 I tried it again because my doctor insisted the drug did not cause the problem since my liver lab tests were good.
 Tried a second time, severe pain came back within one week.
 lowered my cholesterol miraculously.
 I'd rather have a heart attack than live with such pain."
"Always very fatigued and sleepy immediately after taking the drug almost like a sleeping pill causes.
 So I take it before going to sleep.
 Strange type food cravings e.g. rich fatty foods like cheese, peanut butter, mayo, eggs, and hot sauce or salt cravings too, and I'm not overweight or pregnant either.
 Periodic or sporadic lower abdominal cramping without the gas and thigh soreness.
 Works wonders on my bad cholesterol and tri's but now my good cholesterol is whacked, lowered.
 Ratio is also a lot better but the lowering of my good cholesterol has my doctor thinking I need yet another drug to bring good cholesterol back up."
"Left shoulder pain and right hip and muscle pain over 3 weeks.
 I'm a physician and initially figured the pain was sports related (although being right handed, I was suspicious about the unilateral left shoulder pain).
 I stuck it out for 3 weeks until I had a significant limp.
 Then stopped Lipitor 3 days ago and noticed a very significant mitigation of the pain - about 80% resolved already.
 The drug worked wonders on cholesterol (down 80 in 4 months), but I'll be starting an alternative shortly."
"had a heart-attack in Jan. 06.
 it will kill some people."
"I was a vibrant healthy woman until Easter Saturday, 2006.
 On Easter Sunday my ankles, feet, wrists, and knees seized up.
 I am now off Lipitor and I am assured that I will make a full recovery within six months.
 I shuffle when I walk and I am only just coping.
 I am not quite a vegetable, but not far off.
 I started using the drug in Sept. 2005.
 In October/November I noticed my hands were nowhere near as strong as they once were - thought it was old age.
 I also had a strange senistivity in the palms and soles of my feet, also in my scalp - it was uncomfortable blowing my hair dry.
 It was not a tingling, just a sensitivity.
 In November, I was running, and my feet felt like led - thought it was old age.
 In December, my ankles started aching - gee, am I getting old!
 In January, I started to go to the gym, and I think that this is where my problems really started.
 My already over-streesed muscles, over a short period of time, went into meltdown.
 This drug is a terrible, terrible drug and should not be prescribed for anyone."
"Live damage of 80-90% as od 5-31-06.
 I'm in the hospital waiting a liver transplant after taking this drug for only 2 months."
"For the most part, no side effects.
 Some gas early on, which has subsided.
 I do have some weight around the middle which I wasn't noticing so much before, but this may be due to fact I'm now in my early 40's.
 I've started exercising/dieting more and lost 15 pounds in last month, but not around the middle much.
 Some darkness in urine, but I think it's due to not enough fluids.
 Nonetheless, I'm very happy with the drug.
 Went from 341 to 220 using 20mgs despite the fact I wasn't dieting as much as I should have been.
 Now on 40mg but am eating more healthy and will have blood checked soon.
 Am hoping to go back to 20mg, though I have not seen any difference symptom-wise between 20 and 40.
 I lost an older brother to a heart attack last year and everyone at the funeral said he had STOPPED taking his Lipitor!
 I won't make same mistake."
"Wow, So Im not CRAZY after all!
 My Dr can't seem to find out why My feet hurt in the morning and unexplained Joint Pain, I get even after just sitting for an hour watching TV in the evening.
 Man I get up and I can hardly walk.
 Stiffness in my feet, and Leg Joint.
 Dr has done X-Ray and everything.
 Im think he is thinking it is in my head all this pain.
 Now when I So called sleep at night I have been noticing I get numbness in my hands, and it isnt due to me lying on my arms or anything, and my Lt Wrist joint, where my thumb is attached, is dislocating or it painfully sticks.
 And I have to painfully put it back in.
 Im going to show this website to my GP!."
"Weak muscles , fatigued , high pck level , high liver enzyme , leg cramps , flared up tendenitis.
 Doctor says unrelated to lipitor.
 he obviously has not seen this web site.
 It is poison for me."
"Very sore and achy joints, especially ankles and knees.
 Mild headache that rarely goes away.
 Feel foggy like in a slight daze.
 Many muscle cramps in legs and left arm.
 Muscle spasms all the time especially right leg constantly feels like a buzzing sensation all over it.
 The spasms rarely go away as muscles are constantly quivering - more at night time.
 Makes me restless at night and hard to sleep.
 I have only been on Lipitor for 3 weeks so I don't know how it has worked on my cholesterol but the muscle cramps,spasms, and joint pain are soon going to force me from taking the drug."
"Sudden, very severe urinary tract infections.
 It took me 8 years to figure out why I was getting these very sudden and very severe infections every 3 - 5 months.
 WHen I stopped taking Lipitor, the infections stopped, too."
"I developed constipation and flatulence, which I had rarely suffered from before taking Lipitor.
 I developed hemorrhoids and even after increasing fluids and correcting the constipation, they did not go away.
 After a year of taking Lipitor my urine started feeling as if it was corrosive when it touched my skin and I developed a rash that I could not get rid of.
 About a month ago, I started to get muscle problems in my legs that made it difficult for me to get up from a sitting position.
 I have also been experience tremendous neck pain in my shoulders that was causing severe headaches.
 After two weeks off Lipitor my rash and the hemorrhoids are gone.
 The weakness in my legs seems to have diminished somewhat in the last day or so, making it easier to get up from a sitting position.
 My neck is still a problem and has not really improved but I am hoping that it will get better over time."
"Severe back and neck pains that led to severe headaches.
 Stopped taking it after 3-4 weeks.
 since then it has cleared up."
"Definitely short term memory issues, but I'm 44 and I suppose it could be part of menopause on its way.
 lowered overall cholesterol and my hdl went up to 59 from 35, and triglycerides went down but not enough.
 LDL down too but not enough so taking higher dose now.
 Worked like a champ at 10 mg for first two years.
 Now switched from GP to cardiologist and he's upped it to 40 mg so will see.
 have only taken 3 tablets since new dosage."
"Awful muscle pain/weakness in legs and arms, memory loss and more.
 For some this drugs works wonders, for me it caused permanent muscle damage and some memory loss.
 It is hard to find doctors that agree with this drug doing so much harm to many of us."
"Very Painful feet for past 3 weeks and lower legs now starting to hurt.
 Can hardly walk without higher pain level.
 I stopped Lipitor for a few days before now and the pain did not subside.
 I now know from this site that it takes longer to recover then a few days.
 This has caused me to miss out on my Summer Vacation with Family."
"After 3 years, I have very painful muscle aches in the neck and back, pain in my knee, severe headaches (getting worse), pain in leg muscles.
 Interestingly, my new doc took me off lipitor a week ago.
 I thought I had a severe medical problem like fibromyalgia, brain tumor, etc Within this week, a lot of my muscle pain has gone away.
 The tightening of neck muscles was causing headaches.
 I am now headache free!!
 Hope I continue to improve---will have to now address cholesterol as it worked wonders with that."
"I have been on Lipitor 40mg. for 2 years.
 GREAT results.
 Went from 256 to 135 and LDL from 201 to 65.
 In the past 3 weeks, I have been experiancing TERRIBLE abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and EXTREME muscle pains.
 I'm a pharmacist, so I know all to well what these side effects are from.
 I've stopped taking it, but the effects are a slow go.
 I would NOT reccomend lipitor to anyone."
"Tiredness, both physical and mental.
 Brain fog.
 Progressively got worse over course of treatment.
 When I started taking it, no immediate side effects.
 I'd assumed that the tiredness was just one of those things that happens with age, like needing reading glasses, or joints aching in the cold.
 Discovered otherwise when I left my Lipitor at a friend's house, asked her to post it back to me.
 By the time it arrived a few days later I was feeling better than I had for months.
 Had previously been on Pravastatin, my doc switched me because cholesterol was still too high, but it didn't have these side-effects either.
 Will ask about whether any point in switching back but won't take Lipitor again.
 Frankly prefer quality of life to quantity!."
"Severe pain in right heel and related tendons.
 Muscle cramping in left lower leg.
 Took 10 mg daily for four months, then finally had to stop due to inablity to walk down stairs due to the pain (I am 41, and run a 5k every day, so this should not be the case).
 Under doctor's orders am to wait for full muscle recovery, then try again at 1/2 dosage.
 if pain returns I will have to seek other alternatives besides Lipitor.
 The drug did knock my cholesteral down by 55%, so I have motivation to try and make it work."
"I have been on Lipitor for over a year and it did lower my cholesterol from 299 to 220, but I, too, have been having side effects, I guess now, that might be attributed to Lipitor.
 I have this weird dizzy/vertigo/un-balanced-type feeling sometimes.
 It is a feeling like I need to hold on to something, in order to make my walk across a large area, like an airport.
 (I fly alot, so I walk throught a lot of airports.)
 I also have a lot of problems with frequent bowel movements.
 I also have arthritic knees, hands that are numb and tingling at times.
 I think since being on this drug, my arms are always falling asleep while I'm sleeping.
 I don't know whether all this is related to being on Lipitor, but after reading some of this posts on this site, it is beginning to make me wonder!."
"STATIN DRUG DAMAGE CLAIM Last week two personal injury lawsuits were filed against Pfizer Inc., the manufacturer of the cholesterol-lowering drug, Lipitor.

"Developed higher levels of muscular aches and pains including joint discomfort all over the body with a stronger concentration in legs, ankles and feet also a heaviness.
 Constant feeling of fatigue.
 Struggling with minimal weight gain, up and down.
 Some depression but could be related to onset of menopause.
 Some frequent upper abdominal discomfort.
 Intitally was placed on Crestor in conjunction with excercise and lifestyle change and developed severe polyathralgia in ankles and leg joints, to the point of not being able to walk and no significant reduction in cholesterol.
 Stopped cholesterol lowering drugs for one year under Dr's recommendation, with excercise and lifestyle change warranting no positive results.
 Taking Lipitor at present and have been for six months with significant positive results after three months, also in conjunction with excercise and lifestyle change.
 Dr and I have agreed to continue use of Lipitor unless symptoms worsen, will discuss other options at that junction.
 Quite satisfied with Lipitors ability to lower my cholesterol.
 Discourage with the side effects as they have seemed to have worsen.
 Family history of Heart desease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, all of which I have not inherited so far, thank G-d.
 So for now I stay on Lipitor with the hope that my symptoms will disapear.
 My Cholesterol is."
"I used to take Provachol (sp?)but I found it caused extreme bloating.
 It also seem to increase my heart rate therefore could not sleep well.
 I requested to take Lipitor (10mg).
 I have been taking it for about three months now.
 I will go for a blood test within a few days so we'll see how good it did its job.
 As far as side effects are concerned, I find that Lipitor also causes bloating and a great deal of gas build up although not as badly as my previous medication.
 I'm finding it difficult to fit into my clothes due to the bloating.
 I also find that it makes me a bit drowsy, almost like a sleeping pill.
 I therefore take it at bedtime but my sleep is not very sound and therefore not refreshing.
 I developed a pain that seems to originate at the base of my neck, travel down to my shoulder blades and then run to my shoulders, elbow and wrist.
 I first attributed this to work stress because I do a great deal of computer work.
 I thought perhaps that I was getting tendonitis looking at th.
 I have begun to take charge of fighting back against the side effects and have been taking multivitamins, B complex, CoQ10, and GasX for bloating.
 I can honestly say that today is the first day in months that I have felt really well.
 very little gas, almost no pain.
 I'll keep tabs on this and will report back on my ldh levels.
 My father used to take this drug and he also experienced bloating and gas.
 He took Tums to alliviate stomach upsets and also cut his Lipitor dose in half."
"My mother started taking 40 mg. of Lipitor 3 months ago.
 During the first month she complained about her head hurting.
 She began getting very confused.
 She was always exhausted, falling asleep all the time.
 Complained about her legs always feeling like lead.
 Within the last six weeks, her physical health has deteriorated to the point of her being confined to a wheelchair, in constant pain with her shoulders, knees, and a feeling like her whole body hurts.
 She shakes as if she has Parkinsons.
 If I had not seen the news recently about the two men suing Pfizer over what Lipitor had done to their lives, I wouldn't have even thought about that being the cause.
 Finding this website confirmed it.
 I have taken her off the Lipitor, and am hoping that alot of her pain and fatigue and muscle problems will start to get better, although it scares me that alot of people are saying they haven't improved.
 I wish I had know about this a week after she started with the symptoms.
 I would NEVER recommend this drug to anyone!
 It has ruined whatever years my mother had left to enjoy life - she was very active for her age - now she's in a wheelchair."
"Aching over my entire body, extreme fatigue, stiffness when getting up in the morning or getting up after being off my feet for awhile.
 Doctors make me feel like I am crazy.
 Also had severe depression.
 Have taken 2-3 different statins.
 Like others who have written in, I have felt as though I am 100 yrs. old.
 There is a wonderful website Spacedoc.net with much information on the statins, and he has published a book as well on the serious side effects of the statins."

"Intense and constant pain in my legs and arms.
 Legs were also very painful to the touch.
 Pain relievers didn't help.
 I was tired all the time, couldn't sleep, loss of sexual desire.
 My Dr sent me to a Rheumatologist as he suspected that I had Lupus.
 Within 2 days of stopping the Lipitor, my symptoms began to subside.
 The leg pain is gone, I have lots of energy and I can sleep again.
 What a concept!!.
 It did significantly and quickly lower my cholesterol numbers, but they would immediately go back up as soon as I went off of it.
 I eat steel-cut oats every day and using natural products like red yeast rice, lecithin granules & garlic."
"muscle weakness, extreme fatigue, can't sleep good, muscle aches and pain.
 I am going to quit taking it."
"this was the last shot at using a statin to reduce cholesterol ldl.
 I have tried all the statin drugs, you know the very expensive drug of choice for all the doc's out there.
 For all of you who now have extremely low LDL and a bad case of joint pain to the extent that it is very arthritic or having bad muscle cramps that you never got prior to the drug, it is from the statins.
 The drug is able to decrease LDL through a mechanism which also destroys and depletes your bodies ability to make CoQ10.
 This is necessary for they health of muscles and joints (that's why you are experiencing the joint pains and numbness).
 Remember your heart is a muscle, guess what is happening to it with the depletion of the CoQ10???
 If you do some research on the internet, you will find that all these statins make no claims/nor have studies shown them to reduce heart attacks, but they cause muscle problems i.e. your heart, this is based on the fact that they put younger and younger people on these drugs and.
 I would recommend that you do your own research versus just listening to the doctor who wants your LDL down to like below 130, neurosurgeons, who have studied this would tell you not to get it all too low.
 And just because your test come back and show your liver functions are fine and don't show any broken down muscle toxins in the blood doesn't mean the lack of CoQ10 isn't breaking down and damaging your muscles very slowly.
 Mine always showed fine and I had severe arthritis symptoms in knees and hip joints (never had this in my life before statins) and bad muscle cramps (also never got those until statins).
 Granted is you have high blood pressure, high LDL, over weight and maybe smoke, then you probably need something to lower the LDL, if you only have high LDL, you don't.
 Read the drug company studies, they even say it may help prevent a heart attack when you have 3 of the aforementioned risk factors."
"I called in a refill for Lexapro and they refilled it with LIPITOR by mistake.
 I went through nearly that whole bottle of Lipitor before realizing the mistake.
 The side effects of this drug was that my MUSCLES ACHED so bad and my JOINTS HURT and I felt like an 85 yr old instead of a 42 yr old.
 EXTREME EXHAUSTION.
 It was bad enough that I unknowingly ramped up on LIPITOR and had to suffer those side effects but I was also as a result cold turkey on my anti-depressant so I had to endure its nasty cold turkey withdrawal symptoms.
 I know that for two weeks I could only work a half day before I HAD to go home and PASS OUT.
 Then I took another week for vacation.
 Went to the doc after the first two weeks of the torment but EVERYTHING checked good cause we didn't know about the Lexapro/Lipitor swap.
 I felt like a hypochondriac but I knew the bone deep aches were not my imagination.
 NOW, I check the markings on my pills.
 Its been over a month back on Lexapro and I STILL have joints that bark at me that I never had problems with before."
"episode of intense dizziness lasting nearly an hour, then an episode of intense chills and shivers lasting nearly an hour, and continued lassitude for another day.
 cure is worse than the problem."
"After four months on 20 mg suffered calf pains in middle of night.
 After 6 months cut dose in half, still calf pains once in a while.
 Now after 2+ years noticed my left hip was bothering me so that sometimes I had to walk a little funny.
 Thought I might need hip replacement (age 71), but it dawned on me that maybe the Lipitor might be the cause of that too.
 I cut dose again in half and am taking only 5 mg.
 Now after one week I notice that hip does not hurt any more."
"My left arm and neck that hurt from chronic pain are now exploding.
 I hope from just taking a short time no perm damage is done.
 The pain is unbearable.
 I was down to a level 4 and now hitting 10 for parts of each day.
 I told the dr.
 I felt socked in the arm, he thinks my chronic problem is just getting worse.
 I hope he is wrong because I cannot take this much longer."
"very productive cough.
 Doctor said it couldn't possibly b e that - I stopped in two days cough had gone."
"back pain, aching joints and muscles, flatulence and wind,hair loss."
"This is the same poster as the previous posting.
 I notice a poster attributed Bell's palsy to lipitor.
 I too had Bell's, I went back and looked at my cholesterol chart and found I got Bell's before I started on lipitor.
 There seems to be a consistent occurence of muscle pain and/or liver problems but I wonder how many other problems are not really attributable to lipitor eg see my Bell's palsy.
 Also I get night muscle cramps but I have had occasional muscle cramps at night since I was a child, Maybe my memory isn't as good as it was but I'm 70 and I still passed one of the hardest bar exams in the country less than 2 years ago.
 However I don't doubt that some unlucky people are having bad side effects, I just wonder about some of the more esoteric ones."
"Deafness, muscle pain, chronic rhinitus, upper respiratory infections, short term memory loss (really scary), tendonitis, fatigue, flatulance, stomach discomfort, abdominal cramps."
"Memory loss/ability to concentrate.
 Prescribed 20mg for the past 3 years or so, my cholesterol levels have all been normal since starting this medicine.
 Originally I was given Crestor 10mg, but experienced muscle pain, and was given Lipitor.
 The only problem is I feel I have suffered memory loss and the ability to concentrate since taking this medication."
"Shoulder and neck muscle pain, tender joints, wrist pain, fogginess, depression when not getting enough rest, possible insomnia.
 I took Lipitor for 7 years due a genetic form of high cholesterol.
 Controlled cholesterol levels very well.
 Never thought it was doing me harm, until my cardiologist bumped me from 40mg to 80mg.
 Had muscle pain that would not go away, memory loss (could not remember names or words at times), trouble sleeping (possibly-I've always had some insomnia).
 Symptoms eased at 40mg again, but did not go away.
 Still felt like an 'old man'.
 Went off the drug after much thought, all physical symptoms disappeared, physiological problems eased.
 Tried Crestor but it was far worse for physical symptoms.
 About to try low does of Pravichol and work up from there."
"muscle pain.
 joint pain.
 weakness.
 overall exhaustion.
 gum ulcerations.
 hair loss.
 I have been off this drug almost 2 1/2 years.
 I am better but far from well.
 still have pain in arms and legs with much stiffness.
 i wish I had never taken this damn drug."
"tingling extremities, bruising, insomnia."
"EXTREME AND EXCRUCIATING MUSCLE PAIN IN SHOULDERS, NECK AND HIP.
 HAS TAKEN 5 MONTHS OFF THIS HORRIBLE DRUG TO BE ABLE TO EVEN LIFT MY ARMS.
 I WILL NEVER TOUCH A STATIN DRUG AGAIN.
 THESE DRUGS ARE ABSOLUTE POISON AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
 SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET."
"never had any problems walking, after liptor had severe muscle spasms in my legs, thigh area.
 had difficulty reaching seat & unable to walk, waited for pain to subside before I could continue, off lipitor now.
 6 months post lipitor I am still experiencing periodic muscle pain & I wonder will I ever totally get back to the way I used to be.
 would be grateful for any advice.
 I am thankful to be rid of the awful muscle spasms I experienced whilst taking lipitor & would advise people to think very carefully before taking this drug."
"The same as many people reported muscle aches as well as tingling in arm and hand, sore shoulder,fatigue,poor sleep although it did lower my cholesterol, I was not warned of the symtoms.
 Surprisingly when I told my doctor I was having these problems he did not suggest stopping the lipitor nor did any of the other specialists I went to see for these symptoms, a friend told me about the side affects after I told her my symptoms, she said they were the same as statins and what was I taking?
 Lipitor!
 I have since changed doctors because my doctor told me he did not believe it was the lipitor since it should have affected me on both arms and hands, but as soon as I stopped the lipitor I stated to feel better, it has been three weeks now I still have some pain in muscles, but severe fatigue is gone, Problem now is my new doctor is suggesting Pravachol!
 I would rather live a shorter life than suffer the pains and fatigue for many years."
"Severe myalgia.
 Symptoms developed and progressed gradually, but stopped within one week of stopping Lipitor.
 Very effective at lowering cholesterol but if you are prone to muscle inflammation or other connective tissue pain (due to rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia for example) I would be very cautious.
 My symptoms developed gradually enough that I assumed I was relapsing with rheumatoid arthritis -- I was astounded to find the problem was Lipitor.
 I had lesser problems with Pravochol but have come to distrust all statins.
 I am focusing on diet, time-release naicin, and fish oil instead."
"I was on 10 mgs. and then cut it in half for over two years.
 Stopped taking it 11/04 due to severe legs problems; muscle aches/weakness/stiffness, cramps in my feet and hands, pain in my arms and chest, memory problems along with vision problems.
 This drug needs to be taken off the market and doctors need to realize how much damage it has done to many innocent people."
"Like a vast majority of those contributing, a lightheadedness, tingling in the scalp, visual deficits (not double vision or blurriness but a sense of my right eye drooping though it is not).
 The lightheadedness and.
 Wokred great at lowering cholesterol from 276 to 194 but at what price?
 It is a bad feeling walking around thinking you've got a tumor behind your eye!."
"Husband gradually developed muscle pains, extreme tiredness, irritability, weird dreams, restless leg syndrome, hair loss, lack of enthusiasm for anything, strange blood test results w/elevated CRP, BUN, Creatinine, urine albumin, increased blood glucose, periodic memory lapses and belly weight gain.
 Perhaps the effects were slower because he was on 75 mg of CoQ10.
 We stopped the drug cold when he stated he felt as if he was losing muscle!.
 Effective dose for most people is apparently 2.5 mg and Pfizer starts people at 10!
 Statins are sneaky and deceptive drugs which have ruined many lives.
 I'm hoping husband does not have permanent heart, kidney and muscle damage."
"75 yo mother-in-law has memory loss, hair loss, muscle spasms in left arm and legs, odd blood sugar pattern, sciatic pain which is not sciatica, periodic back and hip pain, gradual loss of feeling in toes, dizziness, vision problems, extreme tiredness, lack of appetite, and no enthusaism for life.
 She has had several TIAs and who knows what else she has experienced and not reported to us.
 Dr wanted to double dose to 40 mg.
 We took her totally off the drug and she is beginning to have return of feeling in her toes, no more muscle cramps at night or dizziness.
 Taking lipoic acid, vit C & mega dose of CoQ10 and will never take another statin.
 Higher cholesterol in those over 60 is now found to be PROTECTIVE particularly against stroke!."
"depression, exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, memory problems, including 2 periods of amnesia, each lasting several hours, nausea and vomiting.
 lowered."
"Exhaustion, malaise, upset stomach/constant hunger.
 Tried 5mg/day for three DAYS.
 Just can't imagine taking this drug any longer.
 Tried 10mg/day for 8 days one year ago with same side effects."
"Severe lower back pain after increasing Lipitor form 10-20 mg.
 I couldn't get out of bed or walk after taking it for about one week.
 I stopped taking it and I have pain in my right leg.
 It has been three weeks and it is still hard to walk and go to work.
 I thought I had the flu for the first week when I first started taking 10 mg.
 about two years ago.
 Now after getting the back pain when we doubled the dosage, I think it wasn't the flu but a reaction to the drug."
"I have been on lipitor for 10 years for heart maintenance 20Mg.
 Iwas changed to 10Mg and added tricor 145 Mg because of high ldl.
 I do experience leg weakness and cramping.
 cramping relieved with Potassium."
"Stomach irritation, Abnormal Dreams & DEPRESSION!
 I am not normally a depressed person AT ALL!."
"I've been taking Lipitor for three months and just had my blood tests done yesterday.
 I'm awaiting those results, but I've decided to stop the Lipitor.
 My doctor is in complete agreement and has recommeded Zocor once my side effects from Lipitor disappear.
 I've had tingling and numbness in my arms and hands, general achiness all over (similar to flu), and my knuckles are so swollen I can't remove my rings.
 I've also noticed twitching around my mouth.
 My heels hurt in the morning when I first get up, but the pain subsides once I take a few steps.
 My husband has been taking Lipitor for about five years with no side effects."
"Temporary constipation relieved by fiber supplements, gone after about 6 weeks.
 Possibly increased hair loss - (and I am female so it is really unfortunate) but thinning hair among women at my age also runs in my mothers family so can't really blame statins.
 I have a lipid problem that doesn't respond to diet or exercise.
 Agressive cholesterol management is my only option.
 Liptor works.
 I take 40mgs/day, may be able to lower it since my total cholesterol dropped from 300 to 120 in two months.
 My doctor put me on CoQ 10 at the same time as the Lipitor, and explained possible side effects.
 Lipitor actually reversed blockages in one of my brothers.
 4 out of 5 of us are on statins - 3 Lipitor.
 No serious bad effects.
 Try CoQ 10 to prevent/reduce side effects."
pain in my arms.
"Hair thinning, muscle aches, memory loss, tiredness, moody.
 So glad I found this website, I was worried it was just me which is what my GP made me feel.
 Though my cholesterol is good the side effects are not worth it!!
 Time to try new meds!."
"Took for 30 days.
 Was aware of side effects, but DOC assured me they were minimal.
 I started getting some pain in ankles from time to time, I work out so attributed the pain to ""old age"" (45).
 I was in Baltimore on business when one night I started experiencing severe pain in one ankle - I could not sleep.
 I was a bit better the next day, but limped around a bit.
 A week later the pain came back, my ankle hurt so much I could hardly make to work.
 I could not walk up the stairs in my house without extreme pain.
 I felt horrible & made an appointment with DOC.
 Thought it might be gout, but found this website.
 I quit taking the crap before my appointment with DOC.
 The nurse told me ""we have a lot of people who complain about pain"".
 DOC understood and has kept me off Statins.
 I wish those who take this stuff successfully the best, but for those of us who have adverse effects this can be deviating.
 It took me 3-4 weeks to fully recover.
 MD's need to take their patients reports about Lipitor seriously.
 I would rater drink gasoline than take this stuff again! .
 I have to wonder if the effects of this Med are being downplayed by the powers that be.
 ????????????."
"Severe muscle cramps, charlie horse in my calves and feet so bad at night that it brings me out of bed screaming.
 Severe hip & feet pain and stiffness.
 Can't hardly walk when I first get up from sitting short periods or in the morning.
 Shoulder pain, tendonitis in my shoulders and elbows.
 etc
 It did lower my cholesterol but is not worth the side effects.
 I have stopped taking it and will just have to take my chances trying other things to lower cholesterol."
"Weak legs, lack of concentration, slurred speach, loss of balance and loss of short term memory.
 I spent 2 days in the hospital because I could'nt talk without slurring my words, I could'nt concentrate and could'nt walk more than a few minutes without feeling weak.
 I have been off Lipitor for 2 months now and still get sore and weak legs and can barely remember anything that has happened recently :(.
 If you are over 50 it is better to have high cholesterol than too low!!
 Check this site for more Lipitor horror stories.

"leg pain.
 quit taking condition improved."
"I have been on this medication for approximately two years and it has been very affective in lowering my cholesterol; however, I did notice that I became depressed with intermittent muscle pain.
 I recently mentioned this to my physician and asked if he knew if this particular medication causes these symptoms as all my blood studies for liver function, etc have been normal.
 I decided to stop the Lipitor and within a few days I felt so much better.
 I will call him tomorrow and ask if I can be switched to another medication.
 It is a very effective medication, but obviously has its problems as indicated by those patients who had very similar effects."
"unrelenting muscle pain- leg cramps - numbness in both legs - exhaustion - joints poping and cracking.
 took for 4 months - am still experiencing side effects 7 months after stopping the drug - I feel as if I have been aged 10 years and that I have been damaged."
"Elevated liver enzymes, fatty liver, muscle pain, fatigue, rapid weight loss, partial paralysis.
 This was one of the worst drugs I have ever taken.
 I have now been off of this drug for over 5 months and have still not fully recovered."
leg cramps.
pain in my left leg and most of my joints.
"Question: I notice slight swelling of cheeks of my face.
 (Don't think I need a face lift yet) Facial swelling is listed as one of the side effects but my nurse practicioner doesn't say anything.
 I am considering stopping lipitor for a while."
"My body aches everywhere.
 gas, depressed and just lack of motivation for just about everything.
 I have to come off this drug.
 it is awful."
"incredible depression almost immediately after I started taking it.
 crying all the time, not sleeping, reliving of past terrible events that had occurred in my life, like someone pushing a doorbell and holding it to keep ringing and reliving all the terrible negative things in my life over and over again.
 I kept asking my doctor if there were any side effects like mine and he said no.
 I had been taking zocor with no problem but insurance company wouldn't pay for it anymore and made me go on lipitor.
 After about six months I had my docteor write a letter to ins. co. saying I couldn't take lipitor and they agreed to put me back on zocor.
 But the long term effect of those six months sent me into a psyhcological tailspin that I never recovered from.
 I went to three psychiatrist and they finally came up with a diagnoses of bipolar disorder.
 Cause unknown.
 This was three years ago.
 The drug ruined my life, I am now seperated after this all occurred and before the lipitor I was an energtic happy family man with a great wife and two kids.
 I know it was the lipitor because the only other medication I take is an aspirin once a day."
"fatigue, muscle crammps, bloating, and intense chest pains.
 Also depression (on second try).
 After one week, realized that I could not handle this!
 I'd rather live off rice cakes and water.
 I Went on a bike ride and felt like I had the flu.
 Went home, got on the 'net and searched for side effects and was amazed at what I found.
 Went off lipitor, but my doc convinced me to try again.
 After 3 days, same symptoms plus depression and mood swings.
 Stopped again, started watching my diet more closely and have dropped my cholestrol by 30 pts w/in a couple of months."
"Hip pain, knee pain, neuropathy in left foot, general leg pain, mental malaise, arm fatigue especially in the triceps, lack of enthusiasm for familiar activities.
 Almost all symptoms are now relieved after 3 months off.
 This drug helped my cholesterol a great deal and helped to lower my blood sugar which was border line.
 I will help myself with other methods.
 I went off it without consulting my primary care.
 I will never take another statin.
 There were never studies for long term use."
"experienced severe muscle weakness,lost 30 pounds (all Muscle), I had relatively little pain but couldn't lift my arms or legs.
 The muscles just deteriorated.
 I have since been diagnosed with polymyositis .
 exacerbated by Lipitor.
 It has taken me two years since stopping lipitor to be able to walk again.
 Luckily after being admited to the hospital I was seen by a rheumatologist who knew what she was seeing.
 I will never get back the full use of my arms or legs.
 ALL STATIN drugs are dangerous.
 I have heard from two other people who have ended up with Polymyositis from Lipitor."
"Blurred vision, dizziness, brain.
 I will never, ever take Lipitor again.
 I have been on it for more than four years.
 I've taken myself off of it twice.
 Most recently, been taking 80 mg. for two weeks.
 Enough already!
 I can't tell you how I regained my sanity when I found this on the web.
 Do your own research - don't blindly follow doctors who just push pills without regard to long term damage.
 This is the number one prescribed medicine in the US right now, don't expect it to go away unless we stand against Pfizer and the FDA."
"Muscle aches and pains.
 Stiffness of limbs.
 When I sat down for a bit and then stood up, I couldn't move my legs.
 I had to wait a bit before I could get moving.
 Also developed plantar fasciitis in my feet.
 I couldn't get down the stairs in the morning, I was crawling.
 I had cortison shots in my feet (these were just as painful) but they didn't work.
 Stopped taking Lipitor and I haven't felt better.
 I noticed a difference within a week.
 These drugs are poison and should be taken off the market.
 I am now taking CoQ10 with Vitamin E to try and heal my body.
 From all the reading I have done, the doctor should have told me to take this because the statins deplete your body of CoQ10."
"Blured vision, chest pain, sore muscles.
 Very shaky?
 After only two weeks.
 Feels like a 'panic attack'.
 I would not risk taking this drug any longer, I feel like it changed my personality, from happy to a grouch, it is scary it did this so fast."
"Sore muscle all over my body.
 Especially my lower back when I got up in the morning.
 I ran my own test.
 I stopped taking the Lipitor and the lower back pain in the morning disapeared.
 Then I started taking Lipitor after one week and the lower back pain returned.
 I ran this test several times."
"After taking Lipitor(20mg)for 11 months, developed flu-like syptoms such as dizziness,nausea, muscle aches,loss of energy & productivity, headaches (which I never get).
 Have had these symptons for more than 60 days.
 Quit taking Lipitor 2 weeks ago.
 Still no change in side affects.
 I was very active and in good health prior to taking this medication.
 Lowered my cholesterol from 260 to 170.
 Doctor states side affects are very rare and thinks problems are not related.
 Recommend exercise and proper diet to achieve results.
 Please do not take this medication.
 I came across this web-page as a last resort for my agony.
 Thanks to others for contributing."
"I was ok at first and it did lower my cholesterol but a was feeling tired a lot but didn't make any connection to Lipitor.
 after taking Lipitor 20mg for 3 years the side effects for the last few months are: feeling tired all the time, sore weak muscles in left arm and leg, short term memory loss, less patience, loose temper faster, hair loss, comments from friends that I have aged a lot in the last 2 years.
 In the last 3 weeks my neck is in a lot of pain and seems a bit swollen.
 I went to the doctor 11-26-04 and told him that I quit lipitor 11-20-04 and already feel a LOT BETTER except for the very sore neck.
 He said that it is a good idea and that it was doing more harm than good.
 I have been browsing the internet a lot in the last week and there are a lot of people that are having problems with Lipitor!
 A doctor Peter H. Langsjoen says in July 8, 2002."
"Rare Side Effect.
 Total loss of libido.
 I lost all sexual desires and thoughts.
 It took a while to figure out why.
 When I stopped taking Lipitor I was back to myself within 3 days.
 I will never take this drug again."
"Severe neck/shoulder/pain, achiness, acid reflux.
 I went on it for 2 months, I didn't first associate this as the muscle pains they were talking about but within 24 hours of going off of it (with my dr's blessing) I felt much better.
 It did lower my cholesterol very significantly within one month.
 Muscle aches cleared up quickly but acid reflux is still going strong and I didn't have it before."
"Fatigue, toes acking, depression, moodiness.
 Lowers my count to 240 but is it woth it ?
 I've been on Zorcor and Mevacore also but they didn't do the job.
 I'm thinking of changing to Vytorin a new simvastatin/ezetimbe."
"MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED 10MG OF LIPITOR 3 YEARS AGO.
 THIS PAST SEPTEMBER HE INCREASED THE DOSAGE TO 20mg.
 SHORTLY AFTER, I BECAME EXTREMELY FATIGUED AND HAD HEADACHES.
 I HAD TO LEAVE WORK AROUND 1 PM DAILY.
 I WENT BACK TO THE DOCTOR.
 HE SAID IT COULD BE MY THYROID.
 BLOOD TEST WAS NORMAL.
 THE DR DIDN'T LOOK FURTHER.
 I THEN STARTED TO EXPERIENCE KNEE PAIN,,,SEVERE KNEE PAIN.
 MY DAUGHTER FORWARDED THIS WEB SITE TO ME & I BELIEVE IT'S SAVING MY LIFE.
 I CALLED MY DR AND TOLD HIM THAT I KNEW IT WAS THE LIPITOR EFFECTING ME.
 HE TOLD ME TO STOP TAKING IT FOR 2 WEEKS,,,,I'VE BEEN OFF THE LIPITOR FOR 1 WEEK.
 THE KNEE PAIN HAS GREATLY SUBSIDED AND I'M LESS FATIGUED.
 THE HEADACHES ARE GONE."
"I started Lipitor more than two years ago.
 Cholesterol levels were just right.
 However, about a month ago, I started to feel leg pain/spasm/weakness/depressed/suicidal, joint pain and so forth.
 I stopped taking it the same day I felt these symptoms.
 My regular exercise and badminton both have been affected by this medication.
 May be in the near future I would take this drug company to court.
 If you feel any of the symptoms, please dicontinue this drug."

 after 3 days on this drug I was unable to sleep due to symptoms like a very bad attack of Restless Leg Syndrome.
 Then symptoms stated during day too, my legs have been twitching all the time.

 Soreness in right shoulder when trying to sleep.

"fuzzy vision, bad because I only have vision in one eye.
 A month after quiting, it has NOT gone away.
 migraine almost daily, tintinitus,.
 Since I found later that vision problems were listed as a side effect, I have great concern that my doctor, who was aware of my vision problems, prescribed this drug."
"The first day I took Lipitor I couldn't sleep at night because I couldn't relax.
 It was like Restless Leg Syndrome.
 The second day I got very weak, shaky, and had a cold sweat in the evening.
 Had chills till I went to bed.
 Third day was fine.
 Fourth day was a repeat of the second day, only worse.
 I quit taking it then."
"DEPRESSION, INSOMNIA, anxiety, tiredness, decreased eye sight, loss of quality of life.
 Effective drug for lowering cholesterol, but not worth the reduction in quality of life.

 This drug did amazing things with my chloresterol levels, it reduced it from ( Australian standards ) 7.5 to 1.9 ( generally considered OK level is 5.4 ).
 However I gradually noticed that during the day I would get very tired, and have to sleep, and I spend a lot of time driving for work, and also my in sex drive became non-existant ( I`m also told very low levels of chloresterol levels does this ).
 Had numerous odd aches, especially in the leg area.
 Discontinued this drug because of the tiredness factor.
 Felt great after a few weeks without it."
"Extreme tiredness and flatulence.
 Not sure whether it is the Lipitor but I am now tired to the point of exhaustion.

 Exercize is even Less attractive now!."

"For the past year and half I have been taking Lipitor.
 I have been experiencing extreme pain in my should and arm.
 It is the same arm which has no lymph nodes and a modified radical mascetomy.
 I have had 3 steriod shots to some relief -- but -- short lived.
 Finally, dawned on me -- I missed taking Lipitor over the weekend and on Monday the pain was gone.
 Started taking it again on Monday.
 Pain returned.
 Is there a correlation.
 I'm stopping the Lipitor.
 I was due a MRI next week and possibly surgery on right shoulder with the pain."

 Been off Lipitor since 08-23-04 due to severe calf pain.

 10-13-04 Dr put me on niaspan 500 mg to start.
 He is not happy, like I was!!!!!!!!."
"Was put on 10mg, the lowest dose.
 I experienced cramping in my stomach, and some muscle side effects.
 I decided to go off of it after a few months.
 When my Cholesterol shot up to 300, I reconsidered and tried it again.
 But I cut the dosage in half with a pill cutter taking only 5mg per day.
 This is something people should consider.
 Where the first time my cholesterol went down to 188 with 10mg, on 5mg it went down to 198.
 it has since gone up to 220 on that dosage but still a far cry from 300.
 But now (after about 9 months) I am once again considering going off of it.
 I have terrible constipation and have been having bad muscle pains.
 in my neck and shoulders, lower back and right hip,
 Then the other day it was on the news that a study showed statin drugs can CAUSE heart problems.
 and CANCER especially in the elderly.
 It also said that 7 our of 10 researchers who told us they should lower the bar on cholesterol levels (meaning more people should take it at lower numbers) were connected to the drug companies who make and sell it!!!!."
"Terrific cramps in legs and awful gas pains in abdomen and back for the last month at least.
 It lowered my LDL (not enough) but also lowered my HDL as well!!
 The ratio is not good!.
 I started taking Lipitor about 3 yrs. ago.
 I started at 20.
 then my Dr doubled it to 40 and kept wanting me to double it again to 80.
 After me telling him for months I would not do this.
 I gave it (about 2 months ago) but decided to go to 60 rather than 80.
 Well, let me tell you after taking this increased dosage for about two months I've had such gas pains around my abdomen and my back and also leg cramps.
 I finally went to see a Dr in Urgent Care as the pain was so severe.
 He examined me and could not find any swellings etc and asked me if I had done anything different with my meds.
 I told him I had increased the Lipitor and he suggested that I stop taking it ASAP.
 I only stopped taking it last night and I am anticipating that I will feel better (I like to be physical and do lots of walking).
 I tried Crestor a little while ago and ended up in the Emergency Dept. of a hospital here with heart palipations.
 I'm not really very confident in these STATINS!!!
 I honestly feel they are dangerous and am going to try a natural product in the future.
 Thank God for a Dr that finally told me to STOP!."
"tingling in feet & face/abdominal & muscular pain in back of neck/ Cramps in calves, This stuff is horrible!!! .
 You have to fight with your doctor not to take this stuff!!
 Get the word out!."
"Leg calf cramps, eyes feeling of pressure or spaced out feeling.
 Horrible depression, wild mood swings, feeling of impending doom, sinus congestion, extreme fatigue, lack of motivation and diffuculty thinking, memory loss.
 I went from a highly motivated regional manager to a person who dosent want to get out of bed.
 No amount of sleep makes me feel rested.
 My legs are killing me and I thank God I found this website.
 My mind was starting to deteriorate and I couldnt remember anything without difficulty.
 My driving became dangerous.
 I have stopped the cursed drug and after 2 days my energy level has increased dramaticly.
 No one warned me of these risks.
 This drug should be taken off the market."
"Only on since June - started having charlie horses, dizziness, flu like symptoms, and headache that has lasted over 7 days.
 Blood sugar and blood pressure both now elevated.
 Stopped 4 days ago.
 No leg pain or spasms since - headache and elevated blood sugar still.
 Feel shaky and.
 Lipitor given to me as preventitive measure - I have decided I will stay off it and continue more exercise and continue to lose weight.
 I will be going in for testing shortly to see if it made any difference in my chol."
"DEVELOPED LOWER BACK PAIN.
 FOR WEEKS ON END COULD NOT FUNCTION NORMALY.
 HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ACTIVE, WORKED OUT REGULARLY.
 AFTER 2 MONTHS ON THIS DRUG I FELT AS IF I HAD AGED 20 YEARS.
 HAD CONSTANT LOWER BACK PAIN.
 THERE WAS NO RELIEF.
 DID A SELF EXPERIMENT AND WENT OFF THE MEDICATION FOR A MONTH.
 VIOLA!!!
 I STARTED FEELING LIKE MY OLD SELF, OR SHOULD I SAY YOUNG SELF.
 WILL LOOK FOR AN ALTERNATIVE MEDICATION."
"Extremely severe pain in right shoulder as if from extreme workout or injury(none which apply).
 Stopped taking lipitor seven days ago and still experiencing pain in shoulder and tingling and numbness down right arm radiating into fingers.
 No more medications.
 will attempt holistic approach.
 vitamins C and/or niacin."
"I had severe muscle pain and weakness after taking only a few doses of Lipitor.
 My legs were so weak and tired I could hardly walk up and down my stairs.
 I went off the drug for a few days and all the symptoms subsided.
 At my doctor's suggestion, I went on Lipitor again and experienced the same symptoms.
 This was with only a small dosage (I think it was 10mg).
 I could not function; I have never felt such weakness.
 I am now taking Zocor, which certainly has side effects, but I can function."
"I started taking Lipitor after my cholesterol climbed to 310.
 I Did not want to take it because I am a vegetarian, a health conscious person and dislike taking medicines, but my doctor, an endocrynologist, strongly recommended it.
 The first few months I was not aware of any side effects, but about a month ago I started to experience wrist pain, I thought it was my pilates class, but although I rested for 2 months from the class, the pain continued.
 Then about two weeks ago, I got very bad cramps in my toes, they curled down and the pain was terrible.
 About a week ago I was taking a bath and my muscles in my lower abdomen started to contract then the cramp got higher.
 I got scared that I was having something bad.
 After the cramps one night I had such tiredness in my left leg that I could hardly walk, I thought that it was my high heels that I had worn all day.
 Then 2 days ago I woke up with a swollen foot, it was very painful to walk.
 That was it.
 I suspected that it was the Lipitor and came to the internet and read the same side effects in a lot of people posting their experiences with this drug.
 I even thought that I had ALS since a friend of mine died of it.
 It is amazing the amount of people that also thought the same in this list.
 Thanks God for the Internet.
 I stopped taking this medicine 2 days ago, I hope that I can get rid of these effects and that they are not permanent.
 I do not recommend it, unless it is life threatening and then only take it for a short time."
"Was on Provachol.
 Dr switched me to Lipitor since he said it was more effective.
 After 78 days on Lipitor, I had constant low level pain in my butt and upper thighs.
 Strong pain would come and go randomly.
 There would be spikes of pain so severe that I felt like I would collapse.
 Would have to stop standing/walking and sit down for 5 or 10 minutes.
 After I stopped taking Lipitor, the pain gradually subsided over a 9 month period.
 I was pain free for a few months, but the same pain has returned and has been with me for the past 5 months.
 I now wonder if this is a chronic pain condition."
"I Have been on lipitor for several years.
 I have noticed over the last few years that I have not been feeling well.
 The last couple of months I have been suffering with vertigo.
 I have had all kinds of test and they all come up negative.
 I decided to go off lipitor about three days ago to see if this is causing it.
 I have a freind with the same problem and is on lipitor for about the same amount of time as I have been on it.
 I'm hoping that this dizziness will go away in time now that I have stopped lipitor.
 None of my doctors will admit that is lipitor causing the problem."
"Started on lipitor about 6 months ago.
 2-3 weeks ago I went to MD with sore neck/arms (especially left) feeling of breathlessness and anxiety, feeling like something was going to happen.
 MD told me I was depressed and said Lipitor was not the problem.
 I decided to do some research myself and found this website.
 I immediately stopped taking lipitor a day ago and am experiencing weakness in both arms especially left.
 I am very jittery and tingly and itchy.
 I feel like I am climbing the walls.
 This is a terrible medicine!!!
 I will never take it again!!
 It should be taken off the shelves!!!."
"I felt like I had been running a marathon.
 My legs ached, felt weak, calf muscles painful to touch- extreme fatigue, headaches."
"None for the first 5 years.
 It DID lower my cholesterol.
 However, in the 6th year, I developed terrible ankle/knee/leg/hip pain, aching and soreness.
 I thought I had a muscle problem.
 I got so weak I had to use a cane to walk.
 Then, I had to use the handicapped carts in the grocery store.
 Then I had to get a handicapped permit because I could not walk more than 25 steps.
 I could not sleep for the ache and discomfort in my legs.
 I was sure I was a few months away from a wheelchair.
 I was horribly depressed.
 When I asked my doctor about this pain, he took me off Lipitor, and within one week my pain had stopped completely.
 I can walk fine, I can even run.
 I sleep like a baby.
 However, I still cannot walk very far - I think I have lost a lot of muscle tone.
 I will have to build my strength back up in my legs.
 Otherwise, I feel ten years younger."
"Joint pain, back pain, memory loss, increased weight gain, and loss of balance.
 It is terrible, I stopped taking it and am going to kick my doctors butt."
"Muscle pain in feet, shoulders, chest muscle, arms.
 Tingling in extremities and chronic fatigue.
 Headache.
 WHAT A PRICE TO PAY!!
 I have always been athletic (no, I'm not one of those dreamers that pretends I am).
 I bike 60+ miles a week, plus weight train twice a week.
 Usually, I would been sore once in a while from over-doing it, but not for days on end and not in such severity.
 I used a 5 pound sledge to do some work and I felt like I had severe arthritis in my right hand for at least a week and a half.
 I feel very bad for those of you that didn't find out until late about this junk.
 I didn't have any digestive problems, but did have the headache described, and as pointed out by others, nothing will help the pain.
 I have been off this stuff for two days now, and feeling better already.
 I wish you all a swift return to a high quality of life."
"After taking Lipitor for 5 years: pain in the knees and feet, neck and shoulders, abdominal pain and elbow pain.
 I recently completed 12 physical therapy sessions for severe and chronic tendonitis in my elbows and was released with no improvement.
 After searching the internet and reading comments from others who've taken Lipitor, I believe this drug has caused the severe pain I've experienced over the past 3 years.
 Countless MRIs and other tests have revealed no cause for the pain."
"diagnosed with Parkinsons after 10 months on drug.
 steady weakness onset few months growing on right side of body with tremors."
"inflamatory muscle pain and soreness in upper back, head pain and pressure and the feeling of being in a fog.
 EXTREMELY DANGEROUS DRUG!
 I have never had these problems until I started Lipitor.
 I have discontinued it 2 weeks ago with now a 40% reduction in side effects but the pain is still really bad.
 Does anyone know how long it will take for the side effects to completely go away?
 Will they go away?
 Lipitor lowered my cholesterol from 268 to 163 but it nearly killed me in return.
 It's not worth it.
 The doctor told me I was imagining all this and said it was so safe it should be in the drinking water supply.
 Can you believe that!
 This drug is an extremely dangerous poison.
 The Pfizer website is very low-key about the side effects.
 You better take matters into your own hands as Pfizer's only concern is profits - NOT your health."
"slight flush, sedation, bed wetting.
 Brought scores down 100 points."
"Fatigue, very tired after working hours (and I'm not doing much phisical work).
 Also rush all over my face.
 It helps lower the cholesterol, but I think it's not worth."
"After taking Lipitor for a number of years my muscles and joints in my legs and shoulders gradually became very painful.
 My arms are so weak I can hardly lift them.
 I stopped taking the drug for about a month.
 Symptoms have decreased but I am worried I have caused permanent damage to my shoulder joints.
 I also cannot concentrate like I used to I get tired vry easily.
 Lipitor reduced my cholesterol, but the side effects are too great."
"First of all, I noticed severe lower back pain.
 I put this off as a work-out related pain.
 After the pain intensified after it should have gone away, I became concerned.
 Then I noticed that my knee and my right hip hurt.
 Then I started crying for no reason.
 I yelled at my poor dog for doing nothing.
 ALl in all, this drug really sucks.
 I hate it.
 I hate the doctor that put me on it.
 I can't wait to get off of it.
 I shouldn't have been on it in the first place.
 I swear she must be doing it for the drug compant kick backs."
"Periphiral neuropathy.
 Tingling in hands, face, back and Ulnar nerve sensitivity.
 Effects reversed over 2 months after terminating the 10mg/day dose."
"The side effects came slowly and it took me a while to make the connection.
 I slowly started experiencing pain in one shoulder joint then the other.
 Then deep muscle pain in the muscle of one arm then the other.
 Finally after the muscles in my chest started aching and insomnia had set in.
 I called my doctor who took me off the 10 mg. dosage.
 Looking back I realize now that I had symptoms early on but chose to overlook them.
 Bad choice on my part.
 I hope now that the 9 months of taking these meds hasn't caused permanent damage !!.
 After reading more about the medication I can only say that for me.
 I am done with taking statins.
 I will control my cholesterol by losing weight,exercise and diet.
 It did lower my total cholesterol and my LDL's but the effect it had on my overall well being was too devastating."
"Two days after starting the lipitor I felt like my insides were vibrating.
 I wasn't sure what caused it so continued to take the lipitor.
 I began getting very severe muscle pain in my left shoulder, arm and chest area.
 I was told by the doctor that I probably pulled a muscle.
 After 6 weeks of taking lipitor and constant pain and twitching I took myself off of the medication.
 I continue to have constant twitching and muscle aches in my legs but I've learned to deal with it.
 I've been off of the medication about 2 months and I'm still waiting for it to improve."
"I have had several boughts of severe muscle cramps that lead to dehydration.
 I have had these while on Lipitor and Zocor.
 There is no way I can be dehydrated because I am now aware of the problem and drink water and gatorade consantly when I am outside.
 This site has been amazing to me.
 I am 37 and have been on statins for 13 years.
 Other than the cramps I also have fatigue, muscle twitching, foot pain (10 x-rays), and numbness and tingling in the hands and arms.
 .
 I went to the doctor last week about the cramps, and he took me off Zocor and I am going to wait and see how things are doing.
 The drugs do lower cholesterol."
"Taking 10 mg. of Lipitor.
 Was getting some muscle aches.
 A few weeks ago, got severe intense left arm and shoulder pain.
 My MD (who did not want me to take it) diagnosed a rotator cuff injury (liver test came back normal).
 X-rays did not show a fracture & MRI did not show a tear.
 In the past 2 weeks the toes (esp. the big toe) on my left foot have started to twitch.
 This is really scaring me because my father had Parkinson's.
 Also, in the last couple of days, I have started to get pain between my shoulder blades.
 I have not had my cholesterol tested since I started taking it; but I am stopping it today.
 It seems to work great for some people.
 But everyone should be very vigilant and check out any changes immediately.
 It is too easy to attribute a change to a pulled muscle or aging, etc Thanks for this website."
"terrible nightmares and insomnia, leg cramps, fatigue."
"I have had muscle/joint pain, mainly in my arms which is very painful when I position them in certain ways; otherwise I am just.
 This works for lowering Cholesterol, but not so sure about the big picture.
 I hesitated going on it and now believe my original impression was probably correct.
 I am going to try something natural instead.
 The pain isn't worth it.,"
"Persistent triedness,loss of concentration,uncharacteristical moodiness,short term memory loss,light headedness(in a daze type of thing)unwarranted depression and the occasional thoughts of suicide,tightness and annoying stimuly type of feeling in the neck near the base of the skull,husky vocal chords.
 I am so glad to have come across this Web page.
 Thank you!!!
 I was reading pretty much all of the ones listed and the patterns are obvious to my problems mainly being the persisten feeling of tiredness when i know i shouldn't be tired.
 The light headedness and often foggy vision, short term memory loss and the annoying thing of not being able to concentrate very well.
 Basicaly, feeling way out of myself.
 Many are sharing the same effects and I know now that I am not imagening them.
 I have been on Lipitor 40 mg.
 for some years now.
 It did help my reduction of highg cholesterol.
 It was also a gradual onset of all the above mentioned; This is."
"blurred vision, muscle pain and weakness, fatigue, loss of stamina.
 Within 2 days of stopping Lipitor I feel unbelievably better!!!!
 All negative side effects are gone.
 They snuck up on me insideously over a few months, so I mistakenly believed."
"Took for 5 years and thought foot pain was from bunion and hammer toe until I started to review side effects.
 Severe neuropathy, sensation of cold toes when they were indeed warm and at times I had severe burning of the feet, leg cramps,.
 It may have done an excellent job of reducing cholesterol, but it is important to have quality of life and I did not have that anymore.
 I WOULD NEVER TAKE LIPITOR (or any statin) AGAIN!!!!!."
"The very first day I took 20 mg of lipitor I experienced a severe headache and neck pain.
 I felt light headed and shaky.
 By the fifth day I felt flu-like and very sick.
 The headache was constant and only Aleve slightly helped it.
 I would sit with a heating pad for hours on my neck.
 On day 6 I called my doctor and he told me to stop taking lipitor.
 This is my 3rd day off the drug and I feel 90% better.
 I only had a slight headache and shouldar ache today.
 There are sooo many people that take liptior and never have a side effect and they achieve wonderful results.
 I will never take it again.
 Now I don't know what to do about lowering my cholesterol.
 I really do not want to take another drug.
 I know my doctor will laugh at natural remedies and I do not know how to do it, but I will try."
"recently wrote about my husband who was diagnosed with parkinson's--he stopped Lipitor 4 months ago, and began mega doses of coq10 -and other antioxidants and magnesium orotate- 4 weeks ago--memory problem has disappeared, tremor decreased to a minor.
 we think my husband's symptoms of parkinson's was caused by/brought on by Lipitor's lowering of coq10 and interrupting many other metabolic pathways within the body including selenium production.
 time is required to determine if reversal of symptoms permanent.
 Have received letter about a case of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis dianosis changed to."
"I took this drug a few years ago and went off it because my hair started thinning.
 This time around I am feeling very depressed, tired and nervous.
 I'm not sure if it is the drug, but I'm going to go off it to see.
 Oh, yes, the drug worked wonders on my cholesterol.
 Plummeted about 90 points in a month."
"This drug is NOT fit for human consumption in my opinion!
 I was taking it about 4 months ago and let me tell you, I suffered the worst side effects of the drug.
 I had severe muscle spasms and pain all over my body.
 My doctor sent me to the e.r. from his office and I got there I was in such excruciating pain they e.r. doc had me on morphine!!!
 I am still suffering from the use of the Lipitor.
 There is not a day that goes by where I am not in pain.
 My muscles in my arms and legs are very weak.
 I am 31 years old with 3 kids ages 5, 8 and 11.
 I will be disabled for the rest of my life.
 I will be taking pain meds the rest of my life.
 Please please think twice about using this and other statin drugs."
"Constant aching/pain and weakness in arms, wrists, back of hands and shoulders.
 Pain in lower legs and lower back not quite as severe but still present.
 Gas and frequent diarrhea.
 Difficulty getting to sleep due to aching muscles.
 'Severe aggitation' and quick to snap.
 For a while I was almost looking for someone to push a little too far so I could punch them.
 I usually avoid confrontations.
 The aggitation is one of my biggest concerns.
 Also growing more and more tired.
 I cut the dose from 10mg to 5mg and reduced above side effects by about 40%.
 Surprised when I found others had similar symptoms.
 Took 10mg of Lipitor for 6 weeks and dropped my cholesterol from 310 down to 225.
 Mentioned how I felt and was directed to cut the dose in half.
 Have taken 5 mg for about 4 weeks and cholesterol is now around 210."
"I took Lipitor for about a year.
 I had vague muscle aches and almost overnight developed low back pain where I had to roll out of bed in order to stand up without pain.
 I told my doctor I took myself off the drug.
 I know my own body after 65 yrs and I NEVER had muscle pain before.
 What else could I attribute this pain to?
 Why is there such denial as to the damage this drug can do.
 I admit cholesterol went down but so did my muscles and stamina.
 I feel somewhat better and it is two months that I am off the drug.
 Do Research before taking."
"Leg and toe cramping, leg pain, fasciculations (muscle twitches), muscle atrophy, memory problems, peripheral neuropathy .
 .
 .
 I took Lipitor for 2 years and 9 months before I finally made the connection after a myriad of tests showed no other reason for my array of symptoms.
 Since then, I have done extensive research on statins and would warn anybody on them to watch out.
 Make sure you take supplemental CoQ-10 along with a statin.
 If you start to have any muscle problems, quit the drug while you still have a chance.
 My life has been changed completely for the worse and I will probably never completely recover from the damage caused by Lipitor."
"Muscle pain, muscle twitching, fatigue,.
 I have been off of this med for almost 3 years and still have some of the side effects.
 this is a very bad drug for some people."
"Leg cramps and pain.
 Contracted Peripheral Neuropathy.
 Have lost most of my feeling in feet, legs and hands.
 Tingeling in fingers and feet is painful.
 Difficult to walk and keep balance.
 Difficult to sleep due to burning and pain.
 Took 20 mg for about a year.
 Doctor moved dosage to 40 mg.
 Very slowly over four months I began having leg cramps, noticed I was having difficulty picking my feet up, itching (tingling) around toes of right foot.
 Doctor suspected Neuropathy when Athlete's foot couldn't be detected.
 Neurologist said stop taking Lipitor immediately.
 The damage was done as it spread to my hands and up my legs.
 Have been off Lipitor eight months and still have problems.
 From what I read I fear this will be with me.
 This is dangerous as doctors are handing this out like candy and are not monitoring their patients closely.
 The dark side of Statins far overshadow the benefits."
"severe depression, anxiety, sore joints, sore back, lack of energy.
 I recently went off it after I lost some wheight and felt great.
 did a 220 ldl reading and Dr put me back on it.
 Depression came with a vengence.
 I have never gone for therapy, but had no choice.
 they suggested a connection with the Lipitor, so I went searching - wow what an eye opening - I am not the only one.
 As of now, never again will I take lipitor."
"I have been taking 10mg of Lipitor for 3 months.
 After 1 month I had severe diarrhoea which cleared after 1 week , so I paid no attention to it.
 Excessive gas another sympton which persists.
 For the past 2 weeks I have had back ache (which I have experienced before) but this time not cured by chiropractic treatment.
 I was puzzled!!
 Recently after walking for a while I experienced severe pain in my right leg from thigh to knee and then to ankle which caused me to limp.
 I found this website and I seem to have similar symtoms as others who take this medication.
 I see my GP tomorrow for the results of my first 3 month blood test.
 I shall come off the medication today.
 Thank you."

 Wore braces on calf, ankle, full knee brace and two small braces and crutches, wrist locked up on me, wore a brace for months, just to mention a few of the problems I had on all Statins.
 Doctors left me on Statins for seven years.
 My advise is not to go on any Statins I still hurt after 2 years off them."
"gas, constipation."
"I am writing this for my husband--memory loss, tremors in right hand, symptoms of parkinson's disease.
 since lipitor causes a decrease in coenzyme q10 and now there is a study in the archives of neurology showing that using large doses of coenzyme q10 slows the progression of parkinson's disease, i wonder how many others have experienced a diagnosis of parkinson's having been on lipitor?
 we began questioning the role of lipitor in Parkinson's when my niece's husband who is 57 was experiencing the same symptoms as my husband(the 57 yr old was diagnosed with Parkinson's 2 weeks ago) and the major factor in common between the 2 of them--Lipitor for 4+ yrs.
 not worth the risks of taking the drug.
 will now control cholesterol with diet and exercise."
"DEPRESSION!!
 muscle twitching and pain, tired, loss of drive, irritable with my loved ones, insomnia, anxiety, loss of desire to do or accomplish anything which is the total opposite of my character and personality, huge drawback in quality of life.
 READ ----->.
 Be careful with this stuff.
 Had a total cholesterol of about 230.
 saw results after first 3 months.
 Had no other health concerns.
 Exercised on a regular basis and am in very good shape.
 This stuff grabbed me and ruined the this last year of my life.
 I have no other risk factors for heart desease except a moderatly elevated cholesterol level, no family history or anything.
 Thought I would take lipitor just to be safe.
 Big mistake.
 Went to my doctor and told him I wasn't going to take the lipitor any more.
 Told him I was presenting with some very adverse signs and symptoms and the only thing that had ever changed was the fact i was on Lipitor.
 He was not happy with my decision and offered a switch to a different statin, I declined.
 He got aggitated and asked what articles I had been reading and where I got my information.
 I told him I didn't need a medical journal to convince me this stuff was messing me up, I was living proof.
 4-5 days after stopping the Lipitor it was like someonebrought the sun out.
 Depression faded along with all the other psychological enigmas I was dealing with.
 The only residuals I am now dealing with are some minor muscle aches and twitching, which are slowly getting better.
 Folks, drugs can be a wonderful thing but that doesn't mean all drugs are wonderful.
 Please, be carefull."

 This is a fairly recent occurance.
 Severe and frequent muscle cramps, mostly in my lower legs and feet.
 Knee pain.
 Generally, I feel terrible.
 I have no energy.
 I have constant pain, sometimes severe.
 Two days ago I stopped taking Lipitor."
"muscle spasms, body aches, itching."
"Forgetfulness, Lack of Concentration, excruciating pain in my legs, insomnia, terrible headaches, itching all over, depression, moodiness.
 It dramatically reduced my cholesterol but the side effects aren't worth the benefits.
 I went to the medical center today because I was feeling so bad.
 I have Lupus so I assumed that it was causing me to feel bad.
 After hearing my symptoms, my doctor told me to using Lipitor for awhile to see if the symptoms go away.
 It never dawned on me that it could be the Lipitor.
 Now that I found your website I feel so much better."
"terrible neck pain, memory loss is just terrible.
 Brain feel kind of foggy."
"severe back pain in the mornings.
 Extreme fatigue.
 Mentally in a daze.
 I felt much better 4 days after stopping Lipitor.
 I am trying a natural therapy to treat the elevated LDL and I suggest anyone that would like to try this solution email larry @ [larryhor@optonline.net]
 It is free and he has no vested interest in the 3 herbs used."
"Started getting ocular migranes and migranes during sexual intercourse.
 Never had migranes before.
 Migranes stopped after stopping lipitor."
"Calf muscles (and foot) tire very quickly.
 This often leads to leg/foot cramps.
 Comparable to fatigue after a long workout.
 I have been taking Lipitor for about 4 yrs - the muscle tiring has become worse with time and now will 'act' up very soon even with a short slow walk.
 This has severely hampered my ability to excercise.
 I first thought this was a response to the diabetes but was recently made aware that Lipitor may be causing it.
 Lipitor did lower my chloesterol soon after starting it.
 It doesn't seem as effective now.
 I'm going to stop taking it because of the muscle fatigue/cramping - hopefully this condition will reverse."
"heavy aching legs, especially in the morning.
 Never considered it a side effect before reading about it.
 Certainly nothing I can't live with unless it worsens and after 10 yrs I doubt that will happen.
 4 yrs on zocor then 6 on lipitor(40mg).
 Cholestrol went from 300 to 200."
"Tight throat, holding water.
 Second time I am trying to live with Lipitor.
 First time was bad, I went with another product which sent me to the emergency room twice, it suffocated me.
 Then I switched to another one which was worse then the second one, kidneys hurt, bladder infection, black outs.
 Now I'm back on 20mg Lipitor and will take them regardless of side effects.
 I have low tolerance to any medications, taking the Lipitor at night so I sleep through most side effects."
"After a mild heart attack 2 years ago I was put on 10mg of Lipitor.
 I began having leg and feet cramps.
 I stopped for a month and felt better but my cholesterol went back up.
 The doctor insisted I go back on.
 When I complained of feet and leg cramps the doctor put me on 5 mg.
 This helped but after 3 months my feet are cramping and I wake several times a night.
 I am also having back and hip pain and am feeling tired and depressed.
 I am going to stop again.
 It is not worth going through the pain.
 The doctor does not believe it is the Lipitor but I feel better when off."
"Very bad pain in left side and buttocks.
 Hurt to get up from sitting position; hurt to walk; hurt to stand.
 Back pain also but much more on left side at waist area and thigh/butt muscle areas."
"Severe numbness in hand such that it wakes me out of my sleep.
 Tingling in feet, soreness in calf muscles.
 Occassional sharp shock like pain in head.
 I have taken myself off because I can't stand the side-effects.
 Never really had high cholesterol but current medical thinking is that lipitor may reverse coronary disease.
 I would rather just walk more.
 Upon reading all of the reviews how long can it be before there is a significant class action lawsuit to stop this drug from being prescribed."
Muscle pain which I thought was Arthritis.
"After 4 uneventful years on Lipitor, I started having intense shoulder and upper arm pain.
 If I don't stop the Lipitor, what will happen?
 Is this life-threatening?.
 Why aren't we told about the consequences of various side effects of Lipitor, so we can evaluate whether to continue with the drug?
 Why doesn't the product literature mention the possible effects of Lipitor on cognitive function?."
"Diarrhea after only one pill.
 Unbearable after two.
 I stopped after 2 days, waited 2 weeks and tried again.
 Same results.
 I have lots of food and chemical sensitivities, so I'm sure this is not a typical response."
"10 MG a day of lipitor and 6 months later I have extreme leg pain in the calves after just walking a few blocks, in a brain fog with memory loss, Vision is giving me problems and feel like shit all the time.
 This drug should have a pre-qualifier before perscribed or better yet.
 take all the statin drugs off the market.
 This drug is dangerous.
 I'm almost inspired to start my own web site to warn people of the risk in taking any statin drug for a quick fix."
"Vertigo, room spinning , dizziness, nausea, vision problems - seeing two or three of everything."
"muscle weakness causing nerve damage and imbalance; stiffness similar to arthritis, s l o w walking and numbness."
"on 10mg tightness and fatigue in forearms and legs.
 Pain in side muscles on one side of chest.
 Off balanced-ness.
 However, I started to have these symptoms to a lesser degree two weeks before I started the Lipitor due to a viral upper respiratory infection.
 These symptoms increased with Lipitor and lessened when I went off it.
 Wondering if metabolic changes battling high cholesterol is the cause rather than the drug formulation itself.
 I will try taking Co-Enzyme Q to moderate side effects.
 I also take Zinc and Omega 3-6-9 capsules (which lowers cholesterol)."
"Stomach pain, Gas, Burping, Diarhea.
 I called the doctor today to report my issues.
 I am waiting on him to call back.
 Looks like I will need to get off of Lipitor.
 The stomach pain comes and goes and can become quite uncomfortable."
tendonitis.
"I have not been takeing Lipitor very long it has only been a few weeks and my Dr has me taking it twice a week but since I have been taking it my right hand has been getting numb and hurting it feels like there is no circulation getting to it and after reading all of this it is probally the lipitor, I am very worried now after reading all of this and feel I should quit taking it."
"serious hands & feet cramping, weakness, painful inflamation of joints/knuckles and significant strength reduction.
 persistent feeling of tiredness and overall muscle soreness/weakness/fatigue.
 All symptoms worse upon waking.
 I significanlty lowered my chol by using 10mg lipitor and excercising.
 However, for months I attributed all my pains to my busy schedule and my exercise routine.
 I went from a 36 year-old who can do 60 min of cardio/45 min of free weights every other day, to someone who can barely pick up his 15 mo. son.
 My life right now is a disaster.
 I've been off it 2 weeks and the pain has only subsided 20%.
 I can barely walk when I wake in the morning.
 I cannot get anything done around the house.
 My life right now is depressing until I get back to normal.
 All exercise has ceased and my wife picks up the slack for chores around the house that I cannot do.
 I HAVE NEVER experienced symptoms like these in my life.
 I am hoping this goes away soon and doesn't cause any long term damage.
 I cannot say that I'd do it over again.
 In fact, at my risk, I doubt I'll take any meds willingly if I can.
 Drug companies really downplay the side effects.
 I know how this goes, I work with stats too!."
"slurring in speech, lower back pain, bloated, constipated and severe hip pain on both hips.
 Memory loss and fatigue and muscle weakness and depression, and sleepless nites.
 Sight loss and very off balance.
 This is so weird, I came on this site due to wanting to know why I was having the hip pain and feeling like .
 ! This is the 2nd time I got on Lipitor.
 Dummy me, got off cause I was not feeling good taking it and was going to have surgery so I got off a couple of months after taking it a couple of months and did feel better.
 Both times I have taken Lipitor, I have gotten some lower back pain (almost like a disc out of place)impossible to move.
 After reading this, I am sure that Lipitor is causing all this.
 I did feel better health and mood and no pain before I started taking this Lipitor both times.
 I am amazed that it didn't dawn on me.
 Have a 5 month supply but getting off quick!."
"severe edema with swelling of limbs, vision problems, weakness, muscle pain, rhabdomyolysis/muscle loss, rapid pulse, cough, poor coordination while walking, dizziness, difficulty sleeping, increased sensitivity to other drugs, sweating, nausea, frequent headaches, numbness/tingling?aching/ heavy feeling in limps, difficulty walking due to swelling in legs and problems with coordination, fatigue, increased.
 I was told that what I went through was a rare experience for people on Lipitor and other statins; but I had two reactions this past year to Lipitor first and then later to the Pravachol my Dr switched me over to.
 I can't remember how long I was on Lipitor (maybe 8-10 months).
 I was on Pravachol for 2 months when I ended up with similar problems.
 Stopped statins 4 months ago.
 still having a lot of problems but there was a dramtic decrease in symptoms after stopping both the Lipitor and the Pravachol."
"after one week i started with chest tightness and numness aching feeling to my left arm also pain inbetween both shoulder blades .
 also would wake up feeling shakey headache and just more tiered.
 called my dr.
 he said to stop takeing it.
 so now i must lower my cholesterol with diet and exercise.
 not for all ."
"Weakness, cramping, muscle spasms.
 Slurred speech and difficulty swallowing.
 Have recently been diagnosed with ALS.
 I blame lipitor."
"After about 4 months of taking Lipitor, one day while walking, my left leg, below the knee, experienced intense pain and stiffness.
 Symtoms have persisted for a week and after reading the comments on this board, I am stopping it.
 While it worked well by lowering my cholesterol, I had no idea this was a side affect."
"So sad to see so many with problems like mine!
 Progressively worsening problems with joint pain, muscle pain, depression and tiredness.
 Doctor has ran all sorts of tests and oculdn't find anything wrong, everyone was pointing to arthristis.
 I stopped taking Lipitor and many of the problems went away after 2 days.
 I'm not going back to it."
"Not sure if related, but increase in burning sensations in legs and hands started around the time this drug was added to my list."
"weakness, tired all the time, leg, arm and back pain, not concentrating well, flu symptons randomly every few weeks, bad dreams a lot, purple sploches around waist.
 I know that it works but I would rather feel like my old self as I have always been active and love exercising but on this medication I have to make myself get out and walk and go to my gym classes."
"Zocor [1 yr], then Lopid [1 yr], then Lipitor [5 yrs].
 muscle atrophy, legs & Arms; pain in shoulders.
 Discoloration of skin [blotchy] on the neck.
 Short term memory loss.
 Flatulance.
 Lowered LDL & trigylcerides, but also lowered HDL.
 Started taking 10mg of Lipitor.
 LDL raised about 5 points and Cardioligist doubled the dosage.
 Several years at 20mg really took its' toll.
 Stopped Lipitor, tried taking red yeast rice [natural statin] [1-600mg capsule].
 RYR controlled cholesterol, but is still a statin - similar side effects."
"I had a chronic backache that kept getting worse.
 I complained about this for some time finally a doctor scheduled me for a MRI.
 The results indicated I have arthritis so I accepted that and attributed the aches to simply getting old, (69 yrs).
 Two weeks ago it got so bad that I stopped my regular exercise.
 About a week ago, in the middle of the night after taking my usual Lipitor dose, while making my nightly trip to the toilet, a severe muscle back cramp almost sent me to the floor.
 After finishing my business, I hardly could sleep that night.
 As I got out of bed that morning I started getting severe muscle spasms in the same old place.
 The spasms lasted most of the day and gradually the intensity, frequency and duration diminished.
 Since I had done nothing recently to cause a cramp or spasm, and realizing that in the past, the back aches usually were the worst in the morning but got better during the day and best at night just before my Lipitor dose, I suspected Lipitor.
 I quit them 7 days ago and my back has not been this good in months!."
"I had been taking Lipitor 10mg for 2 years.
 About 6 mons. ago, I decided to tell my Dr I was having muscle pain and leg cramps.
 He switched to Pravachol 20mg.
 I lasted about 2 weeks.
 The pain was worse.
 Then I decided to look on the internet to find out what was causing the pain.
 It was Statin.
 I looked that up and found what it does to the body.
 So, I decided to stop taking any drug and take some Q10 to build my body back up.
 Two months later went back on Lipitor with the Q10.
 2 months later, the pain was back.
 Twice as bad as before, plus a whole bunch of other side effects, you see I'm seriuosly allergic to the Statin.
 And I know now, why I should have known this, but no one told me about it.
 When you are taking Statin and drink alcohol the side effects increase dramatically.
 When ever I drank, sipped a little wine, by body hurt so bad, I thought I had the flu.
 And no Aleve, or pain killer would help.
 I thought I was allergic to the alcohol.
 But now I know it was the Statin.
 Here are a list of the side-effects I had, that started slowly and in two years, became unbearable: Insomina,abnoraml dreams, depression, memory loss, photosensitivity, muscle pain, leg cramps, rhinitis, bronchitis, asthma, dry skin, tinnitus (left ear) taste loss, dry eyes, weight gain and finally hypertension.
 During the two years, I was on the Lipitor, all these syptoms started out slowly.
 First came the tinnitus.
 My Dr sent me to the ear Dr.
 Found no problem, I would have to live with it.
 Second, came depression, Dr put me on Zoloft.
 Then came the sinus problems, Dr put me on Rhinocort.
 During all this I felt like I was 80 years old.
 My neck hurt, my hips hurt.
 We got a $3,000.00 sleep by number bed to relieve the pain.
 Didn't really help.
 Insomia was constant.
 I got hooked on Tylenol PM.
 I gained a lot of weight.
 Went to Lindora to loss weight, so I could get off the Lipitor.
 Lost 40 lbs.
 Dr said to stay on Lipitor for prevention.
 This is when I decided to check it out on the internet.
 When I went back on the Lipitor, about 2 months ago, I had a small drink of wine at a wedding.
 That night my body aches were so bad, I could hardly stand it.
 Then two days later I came down with bronhitis, and asthma.
 I have asthma anyway, but it was the worse case I've had in 13 years.
 Then I had sinus problems again.
 My Dr took x-rays for pneumonia and sinus infection, Came back clear.
 My Dr wanted me to see an ear nose and throat Dr Then my blood pressure went up to 198/90.
 I have never in my life had high blood pressure.
 Dr put me on Norvasc.
 Then I had two horrible nightmares.
 I finally, went on the internet and looked at side effects for Lipitor.
 When I saw all the side-effects, I nearly died.
 I have all the syptoms.
 I stopped taking Lipitor that instant.
 That was one week ago.
 I'm starting feel a little better.
 I've gone to my Dr and asked him if he new about the alcohol related problem.
 He said, no.
 There is no warning on the prescription bottle, to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol.
 The Dr is now doing tests, to see if there has been any damage to my heart and muscles.
 I also, asked for physical theraphy for my left shoulder and neck.
 My left shoulder is almost immobile.
 I think the tinnitus in my left ear has been caused by the Lipitor.
 I hope it goes away soon.
 I also, lost my sense of taste during this whole thing.
 I would recommend anyone who has experienced any side effects increased by alcohol, to consider an allergic reaction to the drug.
 Dr was thinking about putting on another Statin drug.
 I said, don't you get it, I'm allergic to it.

"heavy legs, muscle aches, confusion, not able to remember things like whether I had done something or where I had placed something, stomach upset, indigestion, insomnia, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, twitching, depression worse, fibromyalgia much worse.
 Did help lower my bad cholesterol but caused me to crave sweets and carbohydrates.
 Constipation to the point I suffered bouts of diverticulitis.
 It happened gradually and I didn't realize it was Lipitor, neither did my MD, said perhaps beginning of MS or lupus.
 I hope these side effects all go away eventually."
"Both husband and wife on low dosage (10 mg)
 We are having extreme reactions to heat.
 When the weather is hot we both get extreme headaches.
 This happens with even slight temp changes/worse with high tems outside.
 (80 degrees is already bad) Husband starts sweating alot.
 Husband also has diabetes.

 Help!!
 Anyone else having these problems?."
"left side of jaw itches ,left shoulder aches and tingles left leg iliotial band syndrome."
"My liver enzymes elevated after 3 months and then doubled after another three months.
 I had muscle pain in the shoulder, arms, legs, a rash and also had four eye hemorrhages (one a month) while I was on Lipitor.
 My docter wanted me to keep taking the drug but I know this is another drug that will follow in the footsteps of HRT therapy.
 We were getting it to lessen our chances of heart attacks and instead it was found to increase the risk.
 With TV advertisements, the drug company is hyping a dangerous drug.
 I wonder how many people will become seriously ill before they pull if off the market.
 DON'T TAKE ANY STATIN DRUGS.
 THEY ARE NOT SAFE !."
"Extreme burning feeling and numbing of my feet that progressively got worse.
 had to stop after a month and a half.
 Burning went away with 3 days."
"Lower back pain, stiffness in joints."
"I didn't think I had any side effects until I started reading through some of the list of problems other people are having.
 I thought it was just the over 40 factor.
 But, I too have joint pain in my knees, hips, lower back, and shoulders.
 I have been having pain in my left thigh.
 As far as forgetting things, I am occasionally saying to my fellow worker.
 It has done a good job of lowering my cholestoral but, are the side effects worth it?."
"Nightmares, knee pain."
"After 1 1/2 years of taking 10 mg/ day I am experiencing constant gas and diarrhea.
 Have stopped taking drug one week ago and hope this goes away.
 Excellent job of lowering my cholesterol!."

 Symptoms still persist 1 week later.
 Don't take it."
"Cramping aching muscles in legs and back.
 Flu-like symptoms and fatigue.
 Foggy, out-of-touch feelings and unable to concentrate.
 I started out with zocor, but developed these adverse symptoms after 3 months.
 I stopped taking it and they went away.
 The doctor switched me to lipitor and the symptoms came right back.
 I will never take another statin type drug under any circumstances."
"After taking 3 or 4 times I started having very intense muscle pain with burning from the middle of my back and around my ribs to the center of my chest.
 It would last from a few minutes to a couple of hours and then fade away for awhile.
 I had the same intense muscle pain with intense burning in my arms, neck and sometimes my legs.
 I stopped taking it for a few days and tried it again with the same results.
 I stopped taking it but it took at least a month for the muscle pains to stop completely.
 My doctor had me try 2 or 3 other similar medications before this one with the same results.
 When I told him that I was still getting the muscle pains occasionally a couple weeks after I stopped taking it he said I was crazy.
 I'm now afraid to take any of the Cholesterol drugs.
 Every one that I've tried has had some really bad side effects."
"I have been taking lipitor for 3 years.
 I though the side effects was just me.
 It wasn't until I talked to a friend and she told me about her boyfriends side effects, it was like she was talking ab out me.
 Memory loss, joint pain, swollen feet and hands, sore ribs, inability to sleep well, no sex drive, moodiness, always tired, lack of energy, increased heart rate, headaches every day, and dry joints.
 This all became worst when my dose was increased from 40mg to 80 mg 3 months ago.
 I have now decided to try other methods to reduce my cholesterol.
 (Mine is hereditary).
 I have a wonderful chiro whom suggested I try lecithin, with Omega 3, and Vit C.
 Here goes, I hope to be to get back to my walk of 6km a day."
"imence pain in legs,calf,feet,cramping in legs and feet,even toes,,armpain,swelling,extreme heaviness in limbs,backache,bloody noes, high cpk, my short term memory is terrible,confusion.
 tingling,buzzing in limbs,big time depression.
 The list is endless.
 I seem to get a little relief and wack.
 Right back again.
 I have been off it approx 5 weeks.
 I have been to neurologists and had emg,bone Dr.for xrays primary Dr And now the major hospital to the big guys.
 I will have a more intense emg and then they will do biopsies on my limbs and thigh.
 not one Dr will blame Lipitor.
 I guess it's the forbidden word to say if it's something negetive.
 This stuff is definitely for everybody.
 By the way I was only on it approx 4 months.
 Sad to read so many people are suffering from side effects of this but good to know I am not nuts and I am not alone.
 A huge money maker so I doubt it will ever be taken off the market.
 I've read short term and long term users of this stuff.
 I am beginnig to wonder if it's just a matter of time for everyone who's on it."
"On Lipitor immediately after heart attack.
 Did not realize how stunned I was mentally and physically, till I stopped taking it because of extreme muscle weakness.
 Mental clarity, reading comprehension, short term memory improved quickly and chest and heart feels normal again.
 Have been off Lipitor for 3 weeks and have not needed Nitro since.
 Still have soreness and weakness in thighs from walking short distances and am still not as sharp mentally as I was previously.
 Suspect slip in vision related to Lipitor since vision is slowing improving.
 The worst thing about this insidious drug was that I did not realize how badly it was effecting me!
 Thought that this was how bad you felt after a heart attack and that I was tolerating the medication well."
"my legs and arms started going numb and tingling.
 extreme fatigue, some concentration problems and feeling stupid .
 doctor said no way could it be possible it was a side effect.
 no way, no how.
 after four months i stopped taking it figuring i had nothing to lose.
 after three weeks symptons have almost gone away.
 no way no how would i take this drug again."
"Extremely dry mouth, severe joint aches, muscle cramps in lower legs, sever swelling of feet, hands and ankles, difficulty breathing, tired, memory loss, mild depression, diminished eyesight.
 While these symptoms crept up on me over an 18 month period, I like many people assume it's an age thing .
 I just turned 50 and family and friends would laugh about my forgetfulness.
 The severity of that memory failure frightened me enough to do extensive research on Lipitor.
 I stopped taking it the next day and within 72 hours my swelling decreased significantly, muscle aches and joint pain disappeared, memory loss is not as severe, breathing is easier, stamina is back etc
 I mentioned these same things to my cousin who has since stopped taking it as well.
 She can't thank me enough for giving her life back!
 I haven't told my doctor yet, she doesn't like when I am informed.
 need to change doctors."
"Severe (burning) pain in upper and lower left arm and left hand, stiffness and pain in both knees, pain in upper back (over left shoulder blade).
 Pain in both elbows.
 Pain in left arm at night intense that I can't sleep and no position seems to relieve it.
 Have ceased to go to gym, as this is wholly impractical, given my loss of fitness.
 Pain is so intense that pain killers do not help.
 I cannot understand why this condition should come on so suddenly.
 It started with a flu-like symptoms, three to four weeks ago, followed by pains in my left knee.
 I am presently being tested for arthritus, but there is no history of arthritus in my family and I am just 61.
 The pain has been so intense that my life is being made a misery.
 Will now stop taking Liptor having read the comments on this site and hope I recover.
 Assuming Liptor is the culprit I am really annoyed with my doctor.
 and will tell him so.
 I went to him feeling totally OK nine months ago and he advised me to start taking this drug.
 Better to live ten years feeling OK and then drop dead of a heart attack, rather than commit suicide to escape the intense pain caused by a prescribed drug.
 ."
"Muscle Pain in left arm and upper back.
 Hair dryness, breakage and loss.
 I was able to stop the muscle pain in its tracks by taking CoQ10 supplements but the hair dryness, breakage and loss is not good.
 Currently trying to find a supplement to counter hair loss.
 If I can find something, I will stay on Lipitor.
 It has lowered my Cholesterol from 11.7 to 7 !
 My doctor wanted me to switch from Lipitor to Lipidil Micro as I was so upset by the hair loss and muscle pain but I have stopped having muscle pain by taking CoQ10 and before I switch to another drug that may have other side effects, I want to research it (Lipidil) further.
 If anyone has experienced hair loss on Lipidil please let me know."
"Muscle pain, depression, dizziness (fainting spells), hair loss, panic attacks.
 My doctor kept changing the dosage, tried Mevacor and Gemfibrozil, as well.
 This went on much too long, mostly due to my inability to make decisions due to statin's brain-draining effects.
 After nearly committing suicide due to statin-induced depression, I stopped all statin meds.
 My depression lifted quickly, panic attacks stopped, my hair started growing back.
 Web searches turned up information indicating that women probably shouldn't be taking statins, especially older women.
 I'm lucky to be alive and will do everything I can to spread the word about this killer drug."
"My doctor has started me out on 80mg a day of lipitor.
 I have only been taking it for a little over a week.
 I started feeling sick to my stomach about two days ago, and I have been feeling very fatigued.
 My head has been twitching and today I noticed hand tremors.
 Also feel like I am in a fog.
 Have not had blood results yet to determine if it has lowered my cholesterol or not."
"Muscle and joint aches in arms, elbows, and calves.
 Felt worse when woke up.
 I'm 53 and it made me feel 83.
 Lots of gas.
 Been taking for 7 years.
 Symptoms appeared first last yr - early 06 - stopped taking for two months, restarted and symptoms came back summer of 07.
 Dosage for past 2 yrs has been 40 mg once a day."
"I've been on it for 18 months and only after 15 months the muscle pain started - particularly in the glutes, calves and thighs but also in the back and neck.
 A general feeling of weakness.
 Difficulty getting up out of a chair.
 I've also had palpitations but don't know if that could be the cause.
 Also a hard to describe feeling like a very inner mild panic attack which only lasts a minute or two and is helped by deep breathing.
 Abdominal rash for the last 6 months - I thought it was shingles but the doctor said no and prescribed an ointment.
 I have had high blood pressure for the last three months too but am not sure if Lipitor could be the cause."
"Stroke like symptoms.
 Numbness and tingling on left side of face and left arm.
 Also effected my equilibrium.
 My cholesterol was at 190 just before a heart attack.
 I was put on 80mg of Lipitor and within 1 week of leaving the hospital I had stroke like symptoms and my doctor immediately stopped the Lipitor.
 Within a few days of stopping Lipitor,my equilibrium returned to normal and stroke like symptoms cleared up."
"hair fell out, insomnia, areas of fat under the skin became sore to the touch, last straw was ringing in the ears.
 I took 10mg of Lipitor daily for about 5 months.
 It did a fantastic job of lowering my cholesterol, and improving the good/bad ratio.
 Eventually, the insomnia, and the ringing in the ears (tinnitus) caused me to stop it.
 After 2 months on nothing I tried 5mg of Crestor (one dose), and had to lie in bed with a heating pad on my legs for the aching it caused (like the flu).
 I know many people who tolerate statin drugs without a problem, but for me, it's just not worth the side effects.
 I won't try again."
"In decreasing order of severity: Extreme vertigo, short term memory loss, tendonitisis in heels, calf leg cramps, muscle loss, severe tintitinitis (ringing in ears).
 On Lipitor for 4 months.
 Switched to Vitorin for six months with decreased side effects, Chlosterol dropped from 220 to 90 but now side effects are worsening, particularly heel tendon bruising and muscle loss.
 See http://www.spacedoc.net/rest_of_my_story.html for articles on side effects.
 Be aware and monitor side effects.
 Red Yeast is a statin.
 My allopathic docs are both taking most folks off statins and recommending slo-naicin and coenzyme Q10 with blood tests every three to six months to see if colesterol remains down."
"Acid Reflux, stomach pain, muscle pain, trouble with liver count.
 I took this drug and it did the job - lowered my cholesterol - at first.
 But then the other stuff started.
 At first indigestion all the time, stomach pain, muscle aches - Dr was testing my count for liver problems - suddenly count was so high it put me in the hospital, yellow skin, eyes, urine dark brown.
 Scary.
 Ran all kinds of tests - surprise - can't take Statin drugs.
 Personally I don't think they are worth it after that scary experience!."
"Depressions, lack of energy.
 Side effects seemed to sneak up on me, it wasn't until I ran out and stopped taking it that I discovered how much better I felt.
 I know several others that take Lipitor without these effects."
"On 10 mg.
 didnt seem to have any side effects and my cholestrol went from 256 to 190 in 30 days-I was amazed but then after another month my cholestrol went back up to 235 and my doctor decided to bump up my dose to 20 mg.
 thats when the severe muscle pain started and very debillitating-I went to a rheumotogologist thinking it was lupus or fibromalgyia as i felt like I always had the flu and she took a blood test and said I had muscle damage from the Lipitor.
 Do the benefits outweigh the severe side effects-Pfizer says it's rare but serious side effects-I know many people that have had the same problem with muscle damage so I would not consider the side effect to be rare and now since I'm off the drug wonder how much permanent damage to my muscles is their due to this awful drug."
"Weakness in both legs, hip pain, knee pain, feet and ankle pain.
 Lower back pain.
 Muscle weakness from the pevis down to my toes!
 Could not stand comfortably for 5 minutes.
 Started seeing a chiropractor for relief-did not work.
 Stopped taking Lipitor 40 ml.
 and side effects started to go away after 5 days.
 Have some lingering aches in legs."
"weight gain, confusion, depression.
 STOP Taking LIPITOR.
 This drug will hurt you more than help you.
 Pfizer should be sued."
"My doctor says my cholesterol levers are lower.
 so that's good.
 But I've been feeling like my mind is fading away.
 and it's a scary sensation, when I can't remember the names of co-workers when I'm talking to them!
 I feel like I'm much older and mentally weaker which is a pretty high price just to lower my cholesterol.
 Others have mentioned the.
 I've stopped taking it - to see what happens.
 I was taking 10mg once a day.
 I'm still on Lisinopril (10mg) and Hydrochlorothiazide (12.5mg) each once a day - taken with the Lipitor."
"Been taking Lipitor for two years.
 The last few days I have experienced swollen legs and ankles and a pain in my lower leg making it hard to get around.
 Thought it might be the Lipitor so I am going to the doctor in a few days.
 I think I will discontinue using Lipitor and try to find another alternative to lowering my cholesterol."

 Excercise intolerance and general muscle weakness.

 Finally I stopped 3 days ago due to a high muscle enzyme and now after reading this site I have .realized all my problems due to this med

 I am not ever going to take it."
"I've been taking Liptor for about a year with no major side effects, but recently I have been experiencing a sore, tingly tongue(Glossitis) and have ruled out everything from toothpaste to spicy foods.
 I have also had dizzy spells, headaches, and trouble sleeping.
 Doctor told me to discontinue Lipitor which I just did a couple days ago and I should know in a month or so if this is the cause (glossitis and other symptoms are listed as possible side effects, although in my case it's been a delayed reaction)
 Lipitor did bring my cholesterol down from 268 to 153 but I want the glossitis,headaches and dizziness to go away.
 I hate feeling this way.
 I will find another way to control my cholesterol if Lipitor proves to be the culprit."
"Did reduce cholesterol but after 18 months suddenly developed muscle cramps and tendon pain everywhere - feet, knees, shins, thigh,hips, upper arms, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, tightened muscles in neck which aggravted spinal disc sysmptoms in areas where I have had problems in the past.
 In great acute pain doing most things.
 Living hell.
 Gave up Lipitor for 5 weeks and symptoms rapidly improved.
 Started taking again and day 1 had very severe cramps and pains again all over everwhere at once, these faded slightly so I thought I would try another - same very severe reaction.
 No question in my mind that it is the culprit."
"Have been on lipitor over 5 yrs.
 As time has passed, I have developed foot, shin, knee, thigh and hip pain.
 shoulder, arm and hand pain - am having balance problems, clumsiness and some memory loss.
 I have had problem with bloating and flatulence big time.
 Dr just took me off Lipitor and Effexor for depression.
 only 2 weeks off.
 so no noticeable change as yet.
 Had an MRI last week to rule out Multiple Sclerosis or any brain problems I HOPE - have not gotten results as yet.
 Lipitor reduced my cholesterol total greatly from 274 to 160.
 HDL went up and LDL and triglicerides went down.
 but looks like the side effects are going to cause me to change meds or quit taking them.
 Do the gym 3x a week and walk.
 am not totally sedentary and watch what I eat.
 but I am a cholesterol mfg.
 (so is my sister).
 right now, I am just HURTING.
 and want to find out WHY.
 stay tuned."
"I was on Lipitor for 3 years with no problems.
 Then I sated having hip/leg/foot pain and numbness.
 It finally go so bad that I could not sleep lying down.
 Also, bouts of nausia.
 I went off the lipitor and within 3 days the pains were going away, 10 days and all was well.
 It is a great med as long as you don't have the side effects.
 My MD says that it is soluble in fat and builds up in the muscle.
 He switched me to Crestor, similar med, but water soluble so it doesn't build up in your body as much.
 So far so good."
AFTER TAKING DRUG BECAME ILL WITH STOMACH PAIN BACK PAIN AND DIZZINESS.
"Swelling left arm, very severe itching, intolerable itching, and vivid weird dreams.
 Also large dark bruise on hand.
 Should be banned."
"I HAVE BEEN ON LIPITOR, 10 MG FOR 1 1/2 YEARS NOW AND AM NOW EXPERIENCING ANKLE, CALF, THIGH PAIN.
 SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE EVERYTHING ON MY BODY HURTS.
 SHOLDERS, HANDS, I CHALKED IT UP TO BEING 58 AND MAYBE ARTHRITIS BUT AFTER READING ALL OF THE VIEWS FROM OTHERS ON LIPITOR I AM CONSIDERING STOPPING IT TO SEE IF I GET MY OLD SELF BACK AGAIN.
 I TOO, AM VERY TIRED LATELY AND NEVER FEEL RESTED UPON AWAKINENING.
 MY CHOLESTEROL ALSO CAME DOWN FROM 250 TO 150 BUT I DID FEEL BETTER AND HAD ALOT MORE ENERGY A 1 1/2 AGO.
 I WILL MENTION THIS TO MY DOCTOR TO SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY."
"General depression and severe insomnia.
 Irrational feelings of impending doom.
 It took 6 weeks for side effects to subside after I quit taking the drug."
"extreme fatigue, short term memory loss, muscle weakness, hip pain, some cramping in toes.
 Have been taking 10 mg of lipitor for 8 months.
 Also on strict low cholesterol diet and taking magnesium, omega 3, olive oil.
 Lowered LDL from 186 to 80 and total cholesterol from 260 to 130.
 have also lost 40 lbs.
 Heart doctor says I should continue taking lipitor because it is good for the arterial walls and heart.
 However, because of increasing bad side effects (especially extreme tiredness and general feeling of malais) am going to discontinue use and maintain strict diet and exercise.
 Benefits of Lipitor on cholesterol levels have been very good but am increasingly concerned about long term side effects."
"sometimes I get cramps in thigh.
 Have taken the above since 1996 -- Can I begin to have side effects now, after all this time?."
"I think I've been ok with this medication.
 I was diagnosed with high cholesterol when I was 19, I'm now 38 and started on Lipitor when I was 31.
 Prior to starting Lipitor my cholesterol level was 8.45(Canada),in Nov/03 my level was down to 6.24.
 Its still a bit high,(Canada the levels are measured different then the US, levels should be below 5.20).
 My mother and I are both recipients of high cholesterol.
 I do suffer migranes, back aches sore neck.
 I do exercise regualarly, but still have pains.
 I am always tired, but I really don't know if this is caused by the medication.
 I have never mentioned this to my doctor, because I just thought this was caused by my job and being run down with dealing with my children."
"Lipitor works fine for lowering cholesterol, but the side effects are killers, apparently.
 I have been experiencing extreme leg weakness and pain, to the point where I cannot take steps without holding on or going up on my knees--which is agony.
 After reading the comments on this page, I am shocked that so many people have experienced the same symptoms (weakness, etc ) after taking Lipitor.
 I've been on the drug 7 or 8 years, and have gone off before when leg pain began.
 But this time the problems came on more gradually, yet more severely.
 They include stiff neck, diarrhea, clumsiness and dizziness.
 I'm going off it tonight."
"depression was awful!!!!
 Took increasing doses to be good.
 Depression increased as well.
 Went on and off it six times and each time I restarted the medicine severe depression reoccured the went away quickly after stopping it.
 Will not go near it again.
 Better a heart attack than suicide."
"Malaise, exhaustion, severe muscle pain, severe depression and anxiety.
 I would go to the gym and be so exhausted from changing clothes and walking upstairs that I could not actually exercise.
 My doctor told me I was making it up because I did not want to take medication.
 It took finding a web site to discover it was the Lipitor.
 I was so depressed I having thoughts about suicide.
 Yeah, that will improve your quality of life!."
"I have been taking Lipitor for two years and have experience leg pain, soreness in muscles and tiredness.
 I am otherwise a healthy person.
 Recently, the pain in my my left leg is so bad that I can't sleep on that side at night.
 My doctor suggested going off lipitor as of today to see if that is the culprit.
 I will post another message when I stay off of it for awhile.
 I really do believe that it is the Lipitor though, as I had never had problems prior to being put on that particular medicine."
"two years of hell, several doctors, many mri's,many emg's for the nerves sensitivity,muscles pains, lead legs.
 I never stopped searching for an answer and not one doctor picked it up even though that's the first question they ask you.
 What medicines do you take?
 Now all they want to do is push more meds, i am taking neurontin,oxycotin, zanax, and celebrex.
 BEWARE."
"Lipitor reduced my readings to almost normal.
 At the same time I suffered from fibromyalgia.
 The pain all over my body got worse as time went on.
 I noticed that when I left my Lipitor at home when I was on vacation or other trip, that I began to feel better.
 My doctor told me there was a remote possibility that the Lipitor was agravating the fibromyalgia.
 I stopped taking Lipitor and feel so much better!
 But, it seems I buggered up my stomach from all the pain killers that I took.
 What to do next?.
 Please be carefull with this drug and watch for all types of body pain,."
"Pain along front and outer side of shins.
 very tender to the touch.
 walking was the worst,some weird toe tingling at times.
 lasted for years, told it was a pinched nerve in my back.
 After reading reports on the internet I stopped it a month ago and its about 50% better already.
 muscle pain side effects seem much more common than realized by doctors or admitted by the company."
"On lipitor for 4 years.
 Reduced cholesterol levels to normal BUT since taking lipitor I've developed horrible pain in both shoulders and left knee.
 Sleeping has become extemely difficult due to pain.
 Have to sleep in a chair most nights.
 Orthopedist seems to think its normal aging (I'm only 55) and internist is skeptical that lipitor is the culprit.
 I have also noticed that I have short term memory loss and am easily fatigued.
 After reading the entries on this site I'm stopping the lipitor today and we'll see the result."
"After a routine check up my cholesterol level was found to be sky high.
 So two months ago the internist put me on Lipitor for high cholesterol.
 The lipitor helped in reducing the cholesterol level by 20%.
 The side effects were terrible!
 I had for a number of years pain in my hipjoints.
 The lipitor increased the pain tenfold.
 I could hardly walk, sit or drive the car.
 The pain I was experiencing especially around the hipjoints was incredible.
 I told the specialist about these side-effects and he told me to reduce the dose from 1 a day to 1 every two days!?
 I had already stopped taking the lipitor for a week and the pain had decreased somewhat.
 I learned from the pharmacist that this drug can cause wasting of muscles and that it was possible to end up in a wheelchair because of it!!
 I am going to start on alternative medicines.
 I am never going to use this medicine again!."
muscle pain related to shoulders.
"depression, general malaise, nausea, taste loss, insomnia, hair loss, bronchitis and/or flu 3 times during winter and 1-2 times during summer, abdominal pain, muscle spasmns in legs and left arm, back pain.
 I felt always like I had a veil over my head and lead in my legs.
 This drug is a nightmare and should be discontinued.
 I had my first child at 34 and my husband and I wanted a second one badly.
 Because of all the medical issues this had to be postponed.
 Meanwhile my husband lost his job and we had to apply for insurance coverage - I was refused due to my medical history even I had been an extremely healthy individual until I was put on this medication."
"After taking it for 3-4 months I had terrible pains in knee, ankle, big toe.
 Couldn't walk or even sleep comfortably.
 I thought I had gout, which runs in my family.
 HMO doctors said not gout, but didn't know what.
 I finally stumbled on this web site, and thought it might be Lipitor.
 I stopped taking it and immediately got some relief.
 That was a month and a half ago.
 Still have some pain and other weird symptoms (eg. popping) in knee, ankle, big toe joints, but it is gradually getting less.
 This drug is too dangerous to use.
 We need something with the same good effects, but not the danger."
pain in knee and foot.
"Terrible pain in hips and shoulders.
 After taking Lipitor for a year, I started having pain in my hip.
 Told Dr about it, he didn't seem to concerned.
 After about 1 1/2 years I started having pain in my shoulders.
 The pain is so bad at this point that it wakes me up at night and extremely limits the use of my arms.
 Dr sent me for x-rays, MRI, to see an orthopedic surgeon.
 All results negative.
 They suggested it could be tendonitis or avascular necrosis and recommended anti-inflammatories.
 Nobody ever suggested it could be the drug until I found this site doing research on my pain.
 It makes me wonder how powerful these drug companies are that doctors won't even suggest that the drug could be the problem.
 I'm stopping this drug today in the hopes that the pain goes away.
 Hopefully I'll be able to play catch with my boys and swing a golf club again some day.
 If I die of a heart attack from high cholesteral in 20 years, so be it.
 I'd rather have a shorter life that I enjoy than a long life of pain."
"Mostly Tingling/burning in arms and legs and back of neck, Some lightheadedness, some memory loss, some chest pain, pain in shoulder-feels like arm pulled out of socket.
 Lowered my cholesterol from 270 to 180 in a month.
 LDL and triglycerides dropped to 100.
 I need to take this due to bad family history, but not sure how much I can take.
 The side effects are very distracting.
 I have been on this for a month and so far I am tolerating this, but if the side effects get worse, I would have to decide if dying at 60 from a heart attack is worse than living in misery until 80."
"Severe cramps in toes.
 Feet sore to walk on.
 Tingling and pain in toes and feet.
 Swollen feet.
 Insomnia.
 Constipation.
 Have only been talking the drug for 2 months.
 Will stop taking it now that I find others with similar problems."
"Made a BIG improvement in cholesterol and triglycerides, but in the three years I've been on it have had extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, depression.
 In recent months I've had chronic elbow pain in both arms.
 It just occurred to me that it might be the Lipitor and this site has convinced me.
 I just threw away a bottle with 10 pills remaining and am going to continue with my diet and exercise.
 Hope my energy level returns."
"skipping heart beats, fast and slow heartbeat, leg pain, chest pain, extreme tiredness, depression, severe arrythmias.
 Went to emergency room with severe irregular heartbeat.
 Stayed in hospital 2 days, nothing was diagnosed.
 Went to cardiologist after release, he took me off of Lipitor.
 All side effects disappeared within 2 or 3 days.
 I have severe heart disease."
gas.
"Both entire legs ached several hours a day, diziness, droped down to 20mg every other day with more exercise and dont really have a problem to say, collest.
 is 158 now.
 Lipitor brought me down about 70 points, but diet was important at the time.
 Ive had 5-bypass 1985 and 9-stents 5 years ago
 Was on Mevecor and asked to change to lipitor as Mev wasn't doing anything.
 I also take some alternatives which have definately made a differance.
 I dropped my Lipitor of 20mg down to every other day instead of just laying off of it and this has been pretty much the case so far.
 Collestrol has stablized at 147-158 and really not on any diet.
 I enjoy eating whatever comes along.
 ."
"After 2 months being on Lipitor I experienced extreme pain and loss of muscle in left leg.
 Advice from Cardiologist was to immediately stop taking Liptitor.
 It was too late, resulting in the loss of being able to work and ended up disabitlity and would like to join a class action lawsuit against the drug company responsible.
 Would like to hear from others who have had problems with this drug."
"Back pain, Lipitor seems to be involved.
 In November of 2005 I was prescribed Lipitor for elevated cholesterol.
 Not really high, but high enough, dosage was only 20 mg per day.
 Within two months, I had developed wicked back pain, along with neuropathy and hypersensitivity that wrapped around my abdomen.
 We suspected the Lipitor was involved, so I went off it, since my numbers had gotten really low.
 I was effectively laid up for about six months.
 Since there was no immediate improvement, we surmised that Lipitor wasn't causing this.
 It's October 2006 now, and I'm starting to feel more like myself, still hurts but I can work around it.
 The cholesterol has crept up, so two weeks ago we started the Lipitor again, and within a few days I was paractically flat on my back again!
 So, I've stopped again.
 It's a bloody shame this is happening, as the drug was extremely effective in dropping that cholesterol.
 Too bad, we're going to have to try something else, I guess."
muscle pain.
"leg pains,thigh cramps, fatique, shortness of breath,cannot walk,indigestion,sexual dysfunction, tired and ache all over.
 nothing but poison!!!!!!!!!!!!!."
"MUSCLE PAIN .
 JOINT PAIN.
 VERY VERY BAD.
 COULD NOT WALK AFTER 60 DAYS."
"mussel twitches every where mussel spasms and cramps.
 would not give this stuff to a goat."
"Cramping and weariness of the leg muscles.
 Always tired.
 After about a year I didn't see any lower chlorestoral."
"I had muscle cramps and muscle pain.
 I had muscle pain in my chest.
 After I quit taking Lipitor for 3 days the pain was almost gone."
insommnia.
"Rash with blisters, severe muscle aches and joint pain, extremely tired feeling, no energy, after taking medicine for two weeks."
"My heart beats went to 30 or a little less stomack heart lungs heart and hard to breath I hert from head to my toe .
 I thought I was going to die for 2 days and nights.
 After I got out of hospital I have trouble doing anything like I was doing.
 I think lipitor and maybe even any statin drugs should be takenoff the market.
 I'll never take anything with statin in it agin."
"I took Lipitor for about 2 months two years ago and it completely changed my life.
 My muscles and nerves have suffered from this.
 I have been diagnosed with fatty liver, leaky heart valves, goiter, neuropthy in both feet since that time.
 Before I stopped the Lipitor I ended up in the ER with a pulse of 156 and chest pains.
 I was a nail tech and needless to say that will never be again with the weakness in my arms.
 I would not give this to my worse enemy."
"Aches in calf muscles and hip joint.
 Wife says I'm crabby when on it.
 Had similar problems with Zocor.
 Taking fish oil (salmon) and glucosamine sulfate has offset the achiness and moodiness.
 Cholosterol levels did go down.
 Dosages Lipitor-10mg Zocor- 20mg."
"blurring eyesight, hair loss, painful leg cramps, muscle weakness in my left arm, hard to walk any length of time, my legs and ankles ache so bad, have been unable to lose weight even when on strict diet, very, very tired all the time; pain in almost every muscle, digestive changes, bloating, gas, diarhea.
 My doctor keeps insisting that it isn't the drug.
 But all of these symptoms have come on since taking Lopid and Lipitor.
 Especially the eyesight problems, even went and bought new glasses and hasn't helped!!
 The fatigue and muscle weakness are the worst.
 Am only in my 40's and feel like I'm in my 80's!!
 Am going to stop taking the drug and see if the symptoms improve.
 In spite of what my quack says!!."
"Body aches.
 Thinking of decreasing my dose from 20mg to 10mg.
 Just read an article about it being very important to take CO-Q10 if you are on a statin because statins deplete your natural CO-Q10 which can affect the heart."
"Was on Lipitor 10 mg per day for about 5 years and experienced chronic and acute back pain which gradually improved but seemed strange to me because I hadn't really done anything to strain my back muscles.
 New doc gave me a different statin but I had leg cramps so he put me on Baycol.
 Baycol was removed from market so next doc put me back on Lipitor.
 My cholesterol level increased to slightly over 200 so my doc increased dosage to 40 mg a day.
 Hand and leg cramps returned.
 Hands diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome and I wore a hand brace to sleep several nights a week which controlled the symptoms.
 Recently developed inflammation of my foot muscles and joints and (apparently) plantar fasciitis of my left foot.
 Doc prescribed 800 mg Motrin qid but the foot problems became worse.
 General weakness in my feet, calves, and hands and tingling and burning in the soles of my feet.
 Depression, for which I've been taking an SSRI for about two years and may not be related to the Lipitor.
 I had high cholesterol (over 350) and was prescribed Lipitor in 1996 after other methods failed to have much effect.
 I have taken two stress tests over the past ten years and was told I had a healthy cardiovascular system with no trace of heart disease.
 I am 6' tall, weighed 177 lbs., and considered myself healthy until recently.
 I need to be able to pass a physical readiness test, including a 1.5 mile run, every 6 months because I'm in the military.
 I took myself off Lipitor because I can not take the physical readiness test.
 In fact I need a cane in the morning to get out of bed.
 I am not overweight.
 I was told to stretch and exercise more but that has not helped my symptoms, which have continued to worsen.
 Until recently I walked to work and shopping, 4 or 5 miles most weekdays, and more on the weekends.
 I also ran 2 miles, 3 times a week.
 Now I have difficulty walking and problems with my balance and I've gained 10 pounds because I've become sedentary.
 Two days after taking myself off Lipitor my feet have improved a little and I'm looking forward to resuming a more active lifestyle.
 I think my symptoms are a result of Lipitor."
"My feet feel like I have stone bruises just in front of the heel.
 My hips hurt on both sides when I get up.
 I walk like an old person.
 My doctor noticed a rough sound in my lungs and a heart murmur that was never mentioned before.
 I'm having tests next week for both.
 I was OK taking 20mg but the doctor raised me to 40mg about 4 months ago.
 It's only since then that I've had these symptoms.
 I'll probably quit completely though.
 I'm not physically able to do anything much.
 And at a young 50 that is just not acceptable."
"Extreme Right Shoulder Pain, more pronounced at night to the point I wake up frequently because the pain wakes me up.
 Also experiencing short term memory loss, irratibility and fatigue.
 On advice from Dr went off it for a week but did not experience any relief.
 It did significantly lower LDL and HDL levels but tired of pain.
 MD will probably send me to Orthopedic Specialist upon next visit.
 Additionaly taking 6mg folic acid and B6 to combat high homosysteine levels."
"Severe headaches.
 Memory loss and extreme tiredness.
 Dr wanted me to take 40mg per day and I said no.
 I would try the 20 mg.
 I am sensitive to medication.
 I was told to stop for a week and call back if my symptoms stop.
 I don't know if I want to take even a lower dosage."
"severe pain in left calf.
 I was only on lipitor for 2 months but I started getting cramps in my left calf and it started to get worse until it was pain and I had trouble standing for longer periods of time.
 Went off the lipitor and within 2 days my calf was better.
 Thank God I only took it for 2 months.
 Sure, it lowered my cholesterol from 326 to 187 but it is not worth it if you have to live with pain."
"I am experiencing lower leg pain that is a throbbing,burning sensation.
 Does not bother in a.m. but begins mid-afternoon and continues into evening.
 Neurologist finds no nerve involvement so think it must be drug-related.
 Are others having this problem?."
"Will not continue taking Lipitor!.
 After taking for only 3 days I experienced general overal weakness.
 fatigue.
 nausea.
 diziness.
 trembling.
 trouble concentrating.
 sadness.
 moodiness.
 insomia.
 neck pain.
 dull headaches.
 feverish.
 clamy feeling.
 tingly feeling in hands and scalp.
 basically felt rotton all day long.
 Would wake up feeling good, but about an hour or so after taking Lipitor all the above symptoms returned.
 Others swear by this drug, but they can have it.
 Doctor took me off of it, but I would have done so myself anyway.
 Felt like I was being poisened quite honestly!
 Thank GOD I found this website, as all I could find on the web was how WONDERFUL Lipitor is!
 Maybe for some, but not for all of us obviously.

"Muscle & joint pain; severe vision problems; fibromyalgia numbness in limbs; lupus.
 IF -0 were a choice, that would have been my rating.
 I lost my job; for 2+ years I got bounced from doctor to doctor with all these symptoms and an illness could not be diagnosed.
 God forbid any doctor want to blame the almighty Pfizer.
 This is THE most prescribed drug in America & it is awful.
 Cholesterol didn't/couldn't cause me near that problems that Lipitor is responsible for causing."
"Muscle wasting; weakness; fatigue; diarrhea; anorexic;.
 Placed on 10 mg even though Cholesterol WNL.
 Symptoms progressive.
 Was on it 18 months with weight loss of 20 pounds and all muscles wasting.
 Kidney function became a problem and significan heart muscle weakness."
"Peripheral Neuropathy.
 This side effect makes you feel like you are constantly wearing heavy socks and gloves.
 It also causes problems with balance - especially tring to walk heel to toe."
"After being on 10 mg of Lipitor for about 3 years, I started to experience speech and swallowing problems which got worse while I continued to take it as recommended by my physician.
 After 6 months, my speech and swallowing were so bad that I stopped the Lipitor.
 It is now one year after stopping and I was diagnosed with ALS (which tests later verified was incorrect) and I think that I am beginning to improve in speech and swallowing.
 but very slowly and I may never get back to where I was before Lipitor.
 It has also affected my memory.
 Had Pfizer just mentioned in their precautions that Lipitor just might cause speech and swallowing problems, I would have stopped taking statin drugs 6 months earlier and I would have been OK again."
"Loss of Vison.
 Was off for four days then My vision cleared up, but has been damaged.
 Others that I have talked to have leg muscle and thigh problems that go up to their waist."
"I have been recently diagnosed with Possible Early Parkinson's symptoms.
 Lipitor is the only medication I have been taking.
 I had joint pains, light headedness(problem keeping balance),Tremors in Right hand, and my hand writting had deteriorated to the extent that I had problem signing cheques.
 Lipitor(10mg) was very helpful in reducing LDL and Tri-Glycerides, but becuase of the side effects I have stopped taking it for last month.
 I am now taking CQ-10(50mg)twice a day and Fish Oil (1200mg) once a day and improving.
 I would like to contact others who experienced Parkinson's symptoms with Lipitor.

"Tired more than ususal, Heartburn.
 10 mg daily Lowered Chlestrol from 220 to LDL 111 and HDL 34.
 Combined with Niaspan and Folgard.
 Still working to increase HDL.
 Eating everything I shouldn't and no exercise."
"After about 1 1/2 years of 40mg my MD upped the dose to 60mg.
 Shortly afterward I began noticing hip soreness and leg soreness.
 It feels like my joints don't want to work.
 Also noticed increase in level of fatigue."
"I have been taking this medication for more than 4 years for cholesterol.
 It has reduced the numbers, BUT I now have totally changed my way of life with general weakness, constant leg pain, and specifically terrible pain in my feet and ankles.
 The bottoms of my feet hurt to the point of where I can no longer walk comfortably, and have experienced loss of balance several times a day.
 It is making me feel like 75 instead of 50 and I researched the web and came to this site.
 I have been telling my MD about symptoms for months.
 Blood tests keep coming back normal.
 Doc says must be circulation.
 I feel like I'm wearing someone else's feet sometimes!
 Tingling toes to numb toes and sore ankles and legs.
 I finally get his attention and he tells me he's changing prescriptions to Mevacore (hello. it's the same thing).
 After research I am quitting the medication and will give it a month to see what happens.
 Anyone put me onto some good information about withdrawals?
 Been reading some things I really don't like."
"greatly reduced cholesterol levels.
 But I've been experiencing muscle/joint pain, mostly in legs, thighs /calves.
 Some in arms.
 At times pain so bad I can hardly move or walk with a limp as I favor the bad leg.
 Works for cholesterol, but if these are the side effects, I think I'll take my chances with the cholesterol - doesn't make sense to have low cholesterol if I can't move or do anything else."
"after visiting this site it is like looking into a mirrow.
 i have had most of the problems many are having,infact it is 4 am can not sleep for just turning in bed is painful.
 decided to do a little research on LIPITOR it has dropped cholosterol from 395 to 187 and tri from 1100 to 300 but i wounder if it worth the side-effects.
 before medication had mild heart attack was put on lipitor, at first i felt good but now back pain and tiredness is at a high level, my wife complains that i need exercise but she does not understand i hurt just as much now as i did with the heart attack, i guess it all boils down to if i could get some rest, but seems impossible for just moving in bed is painful."
"Hell on earth.
 Took 10 mg for three weeks and stopped.
 Will be seeing my doctor in four days and will tell him what I think, It's dangerous stuff.
 Will never touch this junk again.
 Asked my pharmacist about all the pain especially back, he said it couldn't be the Lipitor!
 Really.
 

 I will probably have to take a blood test but, the results will have no bearing on my decision.
 No Lipitor, there is something very wrong with it.
 I'm only 40 yrs old and I felt like 90, on the verge of death.
 I couldn't move because of the pain, couldn't sleep or woke up at 11am and could get out of bed, made very irrational moves while driving, couldn't remember where I left my dog 10 minutes before or who I had dinner with last night, had miniscus surgery 3 months ago and now it is painful again, constipation and stomach pain, always hungry.
 GREAT STUFF.
 I'll take my chances without it thanks.
 Quality of life is more important a number, and I can't stand the smell of tiger balm anymore!!
 I think more reseach is needed, something is not right here."
"Stomach cramps, muscle pain, lower back pain, irritability, flu-symptoms, malaise.
 After reading in several sites what the experiences were of other patients-- I would only recommend Lipitor as a last resort."
"Muscle pain in left elbow, pain in feet.
 After reading all these comments I've come to the conclusion that I too have suffered the effects of this drug and will not take again.
 I'm very curious if these affects can be reversed.
 So glad I happened upon this website."

"Stated with joint and pain and muscle weakness, depression, fatigue and cramps.
 At each annual visit to the Dr I would tell him my symptoms and mention I thought it was the Lipitor, He waould always say no way and I need to continue the statin drug.
 My symptoms gradualy got worse over the next 5-6 years, currently I have muscle twitching in both arms, loss of muscle mass in arms, hands and face with slurred speech.
 Took myself off the lipitor a year ago.
 Joint pain is completly gone.
 Was told my Dr I may have ALS.
 Saw an ALS Specialist Feb, 2002, she said she could not diagnosis ALS at this time as you have to have 3 extermities effected and I have 1 1/2.
 She said she has seen over 100 patients with symptoms the same as mine that had been on statin drugs.
 I can't begin to tell you what a scary year this has been.
 But am holding out hope I will improve in time.
 Have read that some people it taks 1-2 years to improve at all.
 I trusted my Doctor!!!!!!!!
 Now I trust that what I was felling 6 years ago was not all in my head.
 Anyone with simular symptoms or coments please e-mail."

 I have experienced fatigue, hip pain,some joint pain in knee.
 Muscles feel like a wet dish rag.
 took myself off medication.
 will contact md.
 taking 40 mg a day."
"Extreme muscle fatigue(suspect Rhabdomyolosis) leading to tendonitis as a result of trying to perform normal physical work related duties.
 Just starting to regain strength after 16 months.
 Very upset that Doctor prescribed Lipitor after being informed about eye muscle problems with Zocor.
 No discussion of diet or possible side-effects, just here take these pills."
Possible body stiffness and joint pain.
"Weakness,muscle ache,fatigue,noticible loss of muscle structure.

 I would not recommend this drug,my Doctor didn't explain any risk to taking this drug,although it lowered my cholesterol some,I changed my diet and started an exercise plan,I quit taking the drug 2 months ago and have continually lowered my chol. level."
"Daily headaches.
 Reduced cholesterol count from 295 to 182 in one month."
"Muscule aches & pains - Went to the orthopedic Dr for a shot in the knee.
 Liver count went to over 600.
 Stopped taking & liver count went back to normal.
 Then I had a series of tests for pains across my midsection.
 Have Fatty strands in my Liver.
 Now I have Rheumatoid Arthtitis.
 I think it could be the result of taking Lipitor.
 Do not take - Watch your diet."
"extreme muscle spazms in my lower back, eye sight changes, fatigue and weakness.
 I stopped taking the drup almost two weeks ago and my back pain is beginning to go away.
 I would not recommend this drug even though it did work to lower my cholesterol."
"Diarrhea, muscle pain, joint aches.
 Lipitor did a wonderful job on my cholesterol but after about 4 weeks, I developed what I thought were strained muscles from exercise.
 It seems to be getting worse.
 After all I've read, I think I will stop taking this and find another alternative.
 I am a type one diabetic."
"Muscle spasms, joint ache, loss of muscle structure especially in the calf muscles, feel tired and ache.
 It lowered cholesterol and triglycerides.
 Had to take a second medication to lower triglycerides more."
"I took Lipitor for one month.
 I was having severe pain in my legs.
 After I quit taking it, I still have muscle weakness in my legs and pain when I sit down or stand from a sitting position.
 My doctor doesn't seem to know what to do about it.
 I am scheduled to see another doctor next month.
 I was taking 20 mg of Lipitor.
 Everyone I talk to who is taking Lipitor says they have leg pain.
 I will not ever take another Lipitor tablet."
"I thought I was having a heart attack - went to emergency room.
 Problem began while sitting at this computer.
 quick, sharp pain in center of chest, followed by a hot/heated flushing sensation that began mid-torso and continued up to the top of head (top of scalp started tingling and burning).
 Oddest feeling that I've ever experienced - very scary.
 Lasted approximately 45 seconds, followed by feeling of weakness and impending doom.
 By the time I arrived at the hospital I was shaking with chills uncontrollably.
 After tests were run I was told that it wasn't a heart attack or shroke.
 They said it was probably related to stress or a panic attack -- ridiculous because I haven't been stressed and have never had any problem similar.
 Definitely helped lower my cholesterol from 263 to 164 -- amazing, but I'm afraid to continue taking due to experiencing same severe side effects.
 Will discuss further with my doctor."
"My dad has been on Lipitor for over a year, they increased his dose by doubling it.
 Within a month he started to experience lower leg weakness, cramping of the calf muscles after walking only a block and while resting.
 He read an article about Baycor, Lipitor, etc
 We asked his M.D. about this & he told us that the side effects of Lipitor were an INFLAMMATORY muscle weakness & degeneration.
 With my coaxing & the Dr's okay my day stopped Lipitor for one month.
 His legs did not get better OR worse.
 The Dr's have him so worried about his cholesterol that he started taking it again.
 He is now so debilitated, he was using a walker, & his wheelchair is being delivered today.
 We have been to a Neurologist, Vascular Surgeon, and blood Dr
 He can no longer drive.
 He has reduced feeling below the knees, he has fallen 4 times.
 He is losing the feeling in his right hand and the inability to perform fine motor skills.
 With all the tests he has had to rule out other causes, it seems that Lipitor is the culprit.
 Until the dose was doubled my dad was active, able to walk, drive, and enjoy life.
 If Lipitor is the cause of all these problems, high cholesterol does not look so bad.
 I would never take or recommend this drug to anyone.
 It has destroyed my father's life."
"Sever muscle pain?tendons too.
 Tested for all kinds of arthritis by practitionaer who would not believe that Lipitor could cause such reactions.
 Over two years for pain to subside.
 Acupuncturist agrees.
 He too has patients who were prescribed Lipitor and they experience similar reactions.
 A terrible drug that caused me excrutiation pain at times throughout my entire body.
 On Lipitor for only three and a half weeks.
 Over two years to rid myself of the pain.
 Getting out of a car was an ordeal?it was that painful.
 Take the goddamn stuff off the market."
"My boyfriend is 49 and has had high cholesterol for about 10 years.
 his doctor put him on Lipitor.
 he took it twice and could hardly stay awake.
 Also noticed pains in his legs and weakness in his knees after the first dose.
 He has stopped and will not resume this treatment.
 There must be a better alternative.
 Don't do it!
 There are too many websites like these with pages and pages of similar complaints."
"I HURT EVERY WHERE.
 I FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN RUN OVER BY A TRUCK ALL THE TIME.
 I WAS SO WEEK AT TIMES I COULDN'T WALK ACROSS THE ROOM.
 I REALLY THOUGH I WAS GOING TO DIE.
 MY DR SAYS IT WAS NOT FROM THE LIPITOR.
 IT HAS TAKEN MANY MONTHS FOR ME TO FEEL ALMOST NORMAL AGAIN.
 I STARTED TAKING B-6 100 MG B-12 1000 MCG AND 800 MCG OF FOLIC ACID EVERYDAY AND IT HAS KEPT MY CHOLESTEROL IN THE NORMAL RANGE."
"extreme joint pain.
 First started as a stiff neck.
 That went away, then it was my knee.
 The pain has since radiated to wrists and hips.
 I felt general malaise and depression.
 When shopping, I needed a cart for support.
 This is very unlike me.
 I have been on this drug for almost 3 years.
 I have a very high tolerance to pain, so I hesitated to call my doctor thinking the pain would go away.
 When I did call, his advice, get off the Lipitor !
 I was glad to find this site to compare my side effects with others."
"Slowly worsening muscle weakness and fatigue in arms(where hardest daily work occurs).
 Strained or pulled a muscle at the time period of greatest weakness.
 Stopped taking Lipitor after reading about possible side effects(was never told by MD)in newspaper.
 Muscle strength recovered after 3 to 4 weeks.
 Pulled muscle still will not heal after 9 months.
 Have a friend also with a physically demanding job who thought he was just getting old with his weak muscles.
 Guess what he was taking?."
"Extreme lower back pain, pain in neck and shoulders, calf cramping, red bumps on my skin.
 Muscle fatigue.
 I only took this drug for 4 months.
 I have inherited my high cholesterol.
 My career involves great physical activity.
 I thought I had just overexerted myself and was over stressed.
 I had no idea a medication could cause so much economic and physical damage.
 I am still in the process of recovering from both."
"I stumbled across this website which was nothing short of a miracle to me.
 I was searching for answers on why I am in such pain throughout my body, mental confusion at times and also short term memory loss which all seemed to be growing steadily worse for the past few years.
 I blamed it on stress (with a dying husband), arthritis, advancing age etc and even discussed leg pain and body cramps with my doctor which he attributed chiefly to age and arthritis.
 I even had tests done on arteries to see if that could be the cause as I have an aortic aneurysem and thought perhaps my problems could be from poor circulation or blockage somewhere.
 They all checked out okay.
 It has been unbearable for several weeks now off and on and I suffered fatigue, lack of energy and growing depression and a feeling a fragility where I had always been a strong woman until recent years.
 I looked up fibromyalgia thinking I might have that but when I casually looked up lipitor the ratings leaped out at me.
 These people all were experiencing my symptoms!!!
 THANK YOU for providing this web site it may very well have saved my life.
 I am contacting my doctor immediately and as of now no more lipitor.
 It did lower my cholestral but greatly lowered my quality of life and I guess I am going to do exercise and have joined weight watchers and see if I can control it in that manner.
 I am 67 and have been on Lipitor for several years with the symptoms growing steadily until now unbearable."
"Muscle aches, bumps on both sides of my stomach that looks like chicken pots, depression, forgetfullness and severe mood swings.
 Constipation and stomach aches.
 I also have Type II Diabetes.
 My doctor called me Saturday night to tell me that the Lipitor may be damaging my kidneys following ongoing blood work.
 It did lower my Cholesterol from 299 to 249 and counting."
"Constant leg pain.
 Had no idea it could be caused by Lipitor until I found this website and others who have the exact same symptoms.
 Thank you for this website."
"I took Lipitor for 8 weeks and experienced extreme pain in all my joints.
 It has brought me to tears and I have had to use sick leave from work.
 My doctor tested me for arthritis and other problems and all tests came back normal but thank goodness she took me off the Lipitor.
 I would not recommend this medication."
"Other than mild flatulance and things of this nature, I did not connect Lipitor to the terrible low back pain I have had for about 5 months.
 but after reading comments on this website, I am wondering about this back and neck pain that worsens.
 It is a miracle drug along with Vitamin E and additional Premarin.
 My cholesterol was over 600 a number of years back.
 I've tried at least 5 other meds for this condition but this one is most effective.
 The lowest the other ones took it was to 300.
 My endocrinologist thought this was going to be the best it could be controlled.
 So, I really believe in this drug, but must consider what it may be doing to my body and my degree of pain.
 I have taken Lipitor since it was approved 4 or so years ago.
 If anyone has any experience like mine, please email me.
 For the past year my reading is around 170."
"Severe Neck Cramps, Ackey leg cramps too.
 Headaches off & on.
 Tiredness, crabby with spouse more often.
 Can't sleep good at night.
 

 I started out with 10mg, and then 20mg, and then 40mg, before the Doctor saw any good results, but as the milligrams went up i got more & more symptoms, and i had even left my wife due to this drug.
 I felt that i was in another world, and i didn't even need her at all.
 I finally have been reduced to 20mg again, but still having all the aches, but i am now back with my wife, and have apologies for all of my drug reactions towards her.
 We really do have to PAY dearly for getting our HEALTH back people.
 So be careful, and PRAY alot more than normal about your health, GOD is listening to you daily."
"severe muscle pain in left arm and neck and elbow,and prickling,numbness in hand.
 strange poisen-ivy like rash on chest and breast that would not go away UNTIL I stopped taking lipitor.
 I put up with this for 2 years until I realized the medication could have caused it and stopped - things cleared up IMMEDIATELY.
 would prefer to try Niacin - will NEVER take Lipitor again."
"mild flatuelence No other side effects.
 been on it almost two years so far so good."
"Severe back pain, muscle degenerating, can barely walk, extreme fatique,depression,major gastrointestinal problems, feel like an old man.
 Fever, sweats, chills.
 Insomnia,fitfull sleep.
 Neck pain,cracking sensations in my joints.
 All joints and muscles hurt.
 Have been going to Drs. trying to find out what is wrong.
 All tests comimg back negative except ck which is positive.
 They tell me I might have arthritis.
 Have been on this drug since the beginning before that Zocor.
 Am getting worse everyday.
 Nobody ever said anything about all these side affects.
 But have been complaining to my Dr for a while now of terrible muscle pain and nothing was mentioned that it could be Lipitor.
 Been tested for everything from malaria to lupus.
 Was always physically fit and not overweight and maintained an active lifestyle but this has sapped every ounce of energy I have and can't do much of anything anymore.
 Have an appointment with my Dr in a few days and I will be bringing a printout of this site.
 There are other people who are suffering just like me.
 Now I know what the hell is wrong and will be off Lipitor.
 My quaility of life has suffered too long on this garbage.
 Thank God I found this site."
"memory loss - chronic muscle pain - pain in joints - constant itching.
 this drug is a KILLER!!!!
 Do not take it
 Why did they take Baycol off the shelf and not Lipitor
 Check the web for side effects of Lipitor- Lots of similar complaints!!! ."
"severe joint pains, needed help getting out of bed and off a chair, whereas had been previously active, neck pain up to the back of the head, right knee protruding out of joint, whereas left knee remained normal, wrist and arm joints sore, red dots on skin all over body, liver function tests normal, however had all of other side effects.
 Once I stopped Lipitor, side effects went away gradually.
 I had a similar reaction recently to Tricor, another cholesterol lowering medication.
 Had similar muscle and joint pains and decided to go off of that."
"Liver enzymes became elevated after taking the cholesterol-lowering medicines (Mevacor and Lipitor) for approximately 9 years.
 The Lipitor was great at lowering my cholesterol and improving the ratio of my HDL's to LDL's; however, on the advice of my doctor I have discontinued taking Lipitor for the time being.
 I didn't realize that I haven't been feeling well, until I stopped taking the Lipitor and now feel like my old self again.
 It's hard to explain, but I have a better sense of well-being and I've actually lost a few pounds even though I have not changed my diet.
 I feel less bloated, and my stomach feels more comfortable."
"I have been taking Lipitor for at least 5 years and lately I have had very bad muscle pain and fatique not knowing why.
 I am type 11 diabetic and my doctor put me on Lipitor to keep my cholestrol down.
 It has lowered it and kept it down but I was told by the doctor just yesterday to stop the Lipitor because of the syptoms I am having.
 I am hoping that these syptoms will go away since I can barely walk without pain and fatique.
 I have also experienced gastro problem.
 I would like to hear from anyone who may be off the drug and feeling better??."
"I went from a vigorous woman who two years ago spent two weeks walking all over London and Paris, whose favorite hobby was hiking, etc , to a fragile, crippled crone who, for a while, was certain I belonged in a wheel chair, due to the effects of this horrible, killer medication after having hip replacement surgery.
 Every muscle from my waist down was effected, my legs became LEAD, my bladder all but quit working; blood began showing up in my urine, I had every test in the book, went to doctor after doctor, and no one recognized this medication as the problem, until I finally went to a neurologist for my back problems.
 I could not walk ten steps without the most excruciating pain and fatigue, all I ever wanted to do was to sleep or at least lay down.
 I lost all interest in everything, had no energy for anything but the most basics.
 I quit taking Lipitor, ON MY OWN, in August of 2001.
 I experienced a certain amount of immediate relief, and my bladder began working normally again, but still have horrible after-effects, and I don't know if they will ever go away.
 I feel the muscles in my legs will never regain their previous strength, I have constant back pain, I cannot walk a half a block without extreme muscle fatigue and pain in my thighs, calves and buttocks, and I still am experiencing malaise that was never present before.
 I consider myself lucky to be alive!!.
 The more I hear, the more I think people need to be made aware of the dangerous side effects, particularly the effects surgery has on anyone taking Lipitor.
 This is one of the most dangerous medications on the market!."
"feelings of fatigue,muscle and joint pain,insomnia.
 it lowered my cholesterol but not sure it's worth the pain.
 dr put me on provacal for a few months but it didn't get the results she wanted."
"Horrible leg pain.
 turned into an cripple,can't get out of bed in the morning, have hip pain.
 never had a problem with my hips in my life!.
 all my blood,liver function are normal!!.
 can't be!.
 Can't walk up stairs, bend over.
 or walk around the store.
 I use to walk twice a day for forty minutes, now I can hardly walk to my car.
 have tried everything for leg pain, and my new hip pain.
 I live on motrin.
 and asper-cream.
 I am going to stop taking Lipitor TODAY.
 a heart attack seems easier.
 Glad I found this site."
"charley horses,back and neck pain--actually an ache, lack of appetite.
 to even a sense of nausea.
 veneer of sadness.
 my chostral has dropped over the past few months.
 doc is happy with it--326 to 270 in 3 months<?> i'd like tp dp this without pills--."
"Very severe pain in arms, knees, hands.
 Muscle weakness and overall weakness.
 I would not recommend it."
"Severe leg muscle pain and leg cramping which started gradually and within four weeks interfered with my ability to drive because of calf muscle cramping.
 I have been informed by my doctor that my LDL was much improved over the short period while I was on the drug.
 However, this drug has caused a major change in my life style.
 Although I stopped this drug three months ago and I was assured the leg pain would resolve, I have been unable to function because of the continuous leg pain and discomfort.
 I was on 10mg a day and was informed that this was a low dose.
 The result of taking this drug has seriously impaired my ability to take long walks or exercise in general since to do so causes the leg muscle pain to flair up.
 Although I have been assured that this will resolve, I have been off the drug for 3 months and have only experienced a modicum of improvement."
"I have been on Lipitor for approximately two and a half years.
 Recently I experienced losing muscular, headache, neck pain and stiffness, fatigue, memory loss, muscles pain on the left side of my chest, depression, sleepless nites and balance loss.
 It work great on reducing cholesteral level, but its side effects became another problem for me.
 I will discuss it with my doctor in my next visit."
"My Grandmother is in the hopital with side affect of a storke, the Dr now think that it could be a reaction to Lipitor that she has been taking."
"extreme muscle pain in arms and shoulders Particularly in bed at night.
 I was on a very high dose (80mg)as I had two heart attacks attributable to blockages.
 I have been off them for 4 weeks with only a small amount of improvement.
 I have heard it can take several months to get back to any where near normal."
"For about 15 months I experienced SEVERE fatigue, and initially for about three months very bad headaches which diminished in intensity but never completely went away.
 Insomnia, I would wake up at 3:00 am and be unable to go back to sleep.
 Difficulty in swallowing and constipation.
 I went to 3 different doctors for these symptoms.
 All of them dismissed my view that maybe the Lipitor was causing all of this even though the symptoms started about 3 weeks after uping the dosage from 20 mg. to 40.
 I quit taking Lipitor about a week ago - thanks in part to this web site.
 Within 3 days I was no longer consistently waking up at 3:00 am unable to go back to sleep.
 Headaches seem to be dissipating as well, and the extreme fatigue is disappearing.
 I don't expect MD's to be knowledgeable about every drug and I recognize that this drug has probably saved a lot of lives, but it is the attitude that I find irresponsible, that these problems couldn't possibly be caused by Lipitor since as all the doctors said."
"after I had been on it for 3 months,started breaking out in blisters,and my face looked like it was on fire.
 the dr took me off of it.
 but it helped my cholestrol."
"Very blurred vision and lower back pain.
 I had a sudden loss of vision and attributed it to getting older.
 After reading literature on another medication a light bulb went off and I realized the blurry vision was probably due to the drug Lipitor and am stopping the drop today.
 My vision is so blurry it feels like I need glasses."
"None that I know of.
 I am concerned that it aggrivates my Rhinitis and swells the nasal passages.
 After taking Litpitor (10mg) I started on Nasonex.
 I stopped taking it about a month ago to see if I can breathe better.
 Lowered CHol from 251 to 171 with only 10mg."
"Severe Joint Pain.
 Without lipitor total cholestrol is 300 and hdl is 72.
 don't think i need the lipitor.
 the hdl is high because of the Chlorella (3grams daily)."
"depression, muscle pain in shoulders, hips and feet.
 My feet felt like I was walking on small ice cubes when barefoot.
 Big time flatulence, achilles tendon tightness, dizziness, (one fall).
 PCP started me on 40 mg 6 weeks ago, quit 3 days ago, feeling better.
 Muscle pain improved, depression almost gone, fatigue persists."
"Took Liptor for 3 months 2 years ago.
 Developed severe thigh muscle pain (both legs involved) and could not walk 75 feet.
 Took myself off Liptor and all symtoms went completely away.
 Then my doctor had a bright idea to try Liptor again and the same symtoms came back.
 Problem is, went off this drug and I still have muscle problem and at times can hardly walk!
 Now the top outer thigh muscle starts to feel very warm, then get numb and lastly it starts to feel very cool (Like the icy hot patch).
 This drug is so bad, I just want to get back to my normal self, but I feel that the damage has been done!
 Am making Dr appointment to see if anything can be done.
 2-3 month."
"nausea.
 which progressively got worse the longer I took it.
 It became so extreme - it was causing me to be dysfunctional.
 The final week it turned into extreme vomiting and diarrhea.
 I thought I had a flu bug that just would not go away.
 As soon as I quit taking the Lipitor - I had my life back.
 I also experienced memory loss and extreme tiredness.
 I might also mention that I started on 10mg and experienced really no side effects.
 but when I was up'd to 20 mg it all started to go downhill."
"I am thrilled to have found this site.
 The depression, lazyness (I don't feel like doing anything), lack of ability to concentrate, short attention span, feeling of.
 Cholersterol went from 260 to 180 in the first month.
 The stuff works; however it's changed my personality.
 Quality of life is worth something.
 However, I agreed to it because diet and exercise didn't work.
 I had even lost 15 pounds (I'm 5 8."
"legs feel leaden, initially, lower back pain (but I've had that before), cramps in thighs, achy legs, lack of energy.
 More problems with my sinuses.
 Woke up with severe vertigo, but it may be due to a cold virus.
 However, I've never had it before with a cold.
 Severe gas, and intestinal distention.
 Constipation.
 I take other medications.
 Some for high blood pressure, and thyroid medication.
 However, I didn't have side effects from any of those medications.
 When I started Lipitor, Immediately had lower back pain, then pain in my thighs (muscle cramping).
 It doesn't seem to matter what foods I eat, I always get distention and gas while on this drug.
 This is an unpleasant (for everyone near me) side effect.
 Since my Dr is out of town, and I've only been on the medication for 6 weeks (10mg), I'm stopping it until I get in to see her.
 I've also had very different cholesterol readings over the years, and am skeptical that any given time you go in for a blood test, it could be very different.
 It's just that my last one was high (275!) But sometimes it's 170.
 And it's also been borderline for many years, around 200.
 (with the good cholesterol very good).
 I think it's higher these days, because I've been in menopause longer.
 But I wonder if side effects to any drug aren't a message that."
"This is the result of taking 1 pill a day for 12 days: On day 3, I felt stabbing pain above a knee.
 Thought I had somehow injured it - but the pain vanished in a day.
 The next day, I felt stabbing pain in my spine and I thought I had thrown my back out.
 I was hunched over to the left and figured it would take a week to get better, but the pain vanished after a little more than a day.
 I started feeling an odd sensation in the center back of my calves.
 I put weight on suddenly for no reason and ringing in my left ear increased.
 Next the calf sensation turned painful at night and started increasing.
 I figured out these issues all might be caused by Lipitor and stopped taking it immediately.
 But the pain in my calves continued to get worse for several days!
 My legs were waking me up at night and were all contorted.
 I've never experienced anything like it but the nurse said,."
"dificulty in concentrating, short term memory problems, occasional dizziness also leg muscle soreness."
"My Prostate Oncologist prescribed 10 mg per day for high LDL.
 The first day I did my normal excercise routine, ran two miles, lifted weights, etc
 That night I had neck pain, and thought it was nothing.
 Took the second tablet the next day.
 Upon arising on the second day, I noticed that I was very tired.
 Pain or cramping in both quads (above knee, back of leg).
 I was not motivated to do anything.
 Spent most of the day in bed, reading a book, something I rarely do.
 By the afternoon I could barely function.
 Felt generally terrible, flu like symptoms, lower back ache, irritable, no motivation, and pain in knuckles, neck, and both upper legs.
 I had a worse headache than usual (I have migraine), but who knows?
 Went to the internet and found this site.
 Saw Lipitor commercial on TV warning about muscle pain.
 I did not take the tablet today, and I am feeling better.
 I attribute the condition to the Lipitor, although there is no proof.
 I am a prostate cancer patient and take a number of other drugs, which raise the LDL.
 Apparently, some (a few) patients cannot tolerate this drug.
 I note that there are some on this list who have permanent damage, so it is serious for some of us.
 My legs are still sore, and feel worse than they did after a day of agressive downhill skiing a week ago.
 Apparently this works for most, but some people have a severe and not so obvious reaction.
 Stop immediately if there is any muscle pain."
"I've been on Lipitor for a couple of weeks now.
 I've been having muscle fatigue/soreness in my forearms for about a week and now have sore cheek muscles in my face.
 It just dawned on me that my doctor mentioned something about muscle problems and am wondering if this could be the cause.
 I will find out soon."
"Numbness started in left toe & went to right toe then went to all toes.
 Burning feet especially at night.
 I was on Lipitor about 2 years when this started.
 It went to all of my feet.
 My dr wanted to keep me on lipitor but when I quit taking I got better gradually.
 I really had to fight my dr to get him to believe that lipitor was causing this.
 He put me on another statin after a month of not taking Lipitor and the same thing started to happen.
 I am now taking herbs for my cholesterol and it is still high but going lower and my feet are doing better.
 Drug co should inform doctors of these problems so they will understand them when their patients come to them for help and.
 I found that all statins cause this problem and the drug companies should help rather than hide the problems."
"muscle pain, headache, tingling and sunny sensation on my face, gas."
"migrane headaches, very very blurry vision, at times felt like i'm going blind, severe muscle pain and dizziness.
 call your physician to change medicine immediately if you've side effects like mine as this is what I did."
"very very blurry vision, at times felt that I'm going blind, severe muscle pain, dizziness, and migrane headaches.
 please call your physician if you feel like me as this is what I did.
 had to make another entry as i wanted to change the length of medicine taken from 1 day to 1 month as this was a typo on my part."
"After a few months of Lipitor and Tricor started having abdominal pain, some sort of G.I. problems, recently went to the E.R. with severe chest pain and now am waiting for Cardio related tests.
 I think these drugs really screwed me up.
 Don't use statin drugs.
 they are very dangerous!!."
"Extreme agitation, blood vessels in eye burst, slurred speach, hot and cold on and off, constipation, mental confusion.
 I felt like I was having a stroke.
 I had a terrible experience with this.
 My eyes are bloodshot and I felt like I was having a stroke after only 9 days."
"Extreme weakness, diarea, bluss and ititching of the face, so tired would not get out of bed to urinate, sleeping 18hrs day, blurred vision, Dizzy spells,.
 DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION IT IS TOO DANGEROUS."
"Chronic pain in all my joints and muscles.
 Really bad in my thighs.
 I had been on Pravachol for aboout 3 years and switched to Lipitor because it's supposed to lower triglycerides too.
 I had the joint and muscle pain already and was told it was arthritis or neuropathy (I'm also a diabetic).
 My thighs were never this sore before I started the Lipitor, though.
 Both of my parents died at from heart disease at a relatively young age (dad-57, mom-66), but if this is what is causing this pain I think I would rather die prematurely than live like this.
 I am 41 and feel like I'm 81.
 I came across this site while searching for Lipitor side effects.
 I was also going to do a search on MS or fibromyalgia, but maybe I should just quit taking this medicine and take my chances."
"I only took 20 mg daily for 2 weeks - several days after stopping my toes went into muscle spasms.
 Don't know it there was any connection.
 After only 2 weeks on Lipitor, my total cholesterol fell from 306 to 178; LDL fell from 178 to 70; and, my HDL went from 116 to 89 (didn't like this result, but did like the change in the LDL).
 Overall the results were significant.
 I will start taking it again as my cardiologist has encouraged me to stay on the medication.
 After reading many of the comments in this website, I will remain cautious and look for side effects.
 Thank you to all the people who took the time to write and to the people who set up this website.
 Will write again after taking it for a couple of months."
"Joint pain in shoulder, I could not lift my arms over my head.
 Extreme pain in upper back area.
 Pain in knees, short term memory loss.
 Although the drug actually took me from a TC of 250 down to 174, the side effects were just too much to bear.
 I was taking pain killers to numb out the pain from this drug.
 Unfortunately upon stopping my cholesterol went to 280 in 8 weeks.
 I am now starting Pravachol."
"Exhaustion after exercise such as skiing or hiking.
 Heavy limbs.
 It works for reducing cholesterol levels, but after 6 years I'm increasingly wondering about the side effects and looking for alternatives."
"headaches within 2 hrs of taking it.
 Low sex drive."
"Absolutely none.
 No muscle or joint problems through 1 year.
 Worked great to reduce my cholesterol by about 20% within just a few weeks.
 There's a lot of long-term safety data with this class of drug (statins) and I think I'll keep taking it for the long-term benefits."
"After being on Lipitor for only two months, I was experiencing debilitating muscle pain in my arms, legs and back.
 Additionally, I was experiencing severe cramping in my legs and back.
 The good news was that my cholesterol dropped from 269 to 160.
 The bad news was that long term, it would likely impact the heart muscle.
 Once the doctor saw the CPK levels on my next liver function test, he called (himself) and said to stop taking Lipitor immediately.
 Interestingly, Niaspan had the same effect.
 I'm currently trying a therapy of 6000 mg. of vitamin C daily.
 An interesting site for information on this is www.newmediaexplorer.org/sepp/2003/11/09/ vitamin_c_beats_statins_in_cholesterol_heart_disease.htm and http://www.cqs.com/lipitor.htm.
 I'll post again after I have my next cholesterol test (2/7) and see what the vitamin C has done.
 I'm not certain that any of the statins are worth the risk."
"Extreme muscle weakness and thinking problems.
 This has gone on for 2 years now and is not getting straightened out.
 I would not advise any body to take Lipitor unless their cholesterol is over 300 and then only with extreme close care by the physician.
 Physicians should study the drugs they give their patients instead of just taking the pharmacy salesmen word for it."
"aching joints: wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, and gas.
 lowered my cholesterol, but i cannot sleep through the night."
Muscle Pain.
"Slight muscle soreness in arms and legs.
 Major sorness in knees and elbows.
 I have gout and had been attributing the joint pain to that, but after bloodwork, my rheumatologist said it was not gout!
 I have an appt. scheduled to start to deal with this pain but an experience last night and reading some postings on this site are leading me to suspect the lipitor.
 My usual 20mg dose is taken with dinner, but I had forgotten to take it and remembered just before bedtime.
 I awoke at 3AM with an a knee that was just throbbing with pain.
 I hobbled to the bathroom and took a dose of Advil and was able to get back to sleep after about a half hour.
 I awoke this morning with about a 50% reduction in pain and it seems to have subsided as the day goes on.
 I will never take lipitor before bed again, I may cut the daily dose in half and possibly stop altogether if the pain persists at an intolerable level.
 Lipitor has lowered my cholesterol levels to the 180's.
 I had never had a reading below 218 in my life and it has been steadily rising over the last few years to a consistent level in the 240's.
 The ratio of bad to good cholesterol is in the acceptable zone and never had been before taking lipitor.
 So, all in all, the lipitor has done a good job.
 I will try to cope with the joint pain, but if it becomes a constant problem, I will have to stop taking the drug."
"weakness,muscle pain, knee pain,memory loss,etc"
"tiredness, foggy brain, sore feet/legs, left shoulder upper arm pain, occasional neck pain, nose extremely dry/swollen nasal passages, skin - white patches, windy towards evening/night.
 Not good enough for so many side effects."
"Jaundice,right upper quadrant abdominal pain,very elevated liver function tests,itching of the skin,weakness,loss of appetite.
 Gall bladder sonogram,CT scan,MRI of liver ducts all negative for gall bladder disease.
 Hospitalized 4 days.
 six weeks after stopping Lipitor all liver tests returned to normal.
 .
 I am a retired physician and had an excellent therepeutic result while on the medication.
 I did have occcasional muscle aches and flu like symptoms which subsided when a stopped lipitor for short periods of time.
 But the overall good effect of the drug on my lipid profile caused me to return to using it.
 Not any more!
 I could have wound up with permanent liver damage or dying.
 The drug isert for lipitor does mention cholestatic Jaundice in the post market studies.
 no numbers as to the number of cases reported.
 How many go unreported?."
"Constant stomach discomfort and pain, distension, gas, muscle aches, leg cramps.
 Experimentation with stopping the treatment for a few weeks brought relief.
 On re-starting, the symptons rapidly returned.
 I now intend to ask my doctor for an alternative."
pains in my hip- depresion and mood swings.
"First I was having cramps in my fingers, which is now not apparent.
 Recently my eyesight is not good, very blurry and my back pain has increased.
 My shoulders are inflammed and I am now going to the physiotherapist.
 My neck right down to my right shoulder blade is very very sensitive and very very painful.
 The pain has not subsided.
 I am depressed because of the pain, I can't do what I want to do, I have headaches and can't go to work.
 My concentration is poor.
 I also have heartburn and indigestion.
 I am taking pain relievers and anti-acids.
 Lipitor works to reduce my cholesterol from 8 to 5.
 My doctor says not to stop, however I did stop for nearly 6 months and I was well.
 When I got my cholestoerol measured however it went up and I was concerned so went back on lipitor.
 My son says he will find an alternative for me.
 Stay tuned."
"Very very tired, severe left knee pain, feet hurt.
 I believe the discomforts are side effects, but my doc says lipitor only causes muscle pain over the entire body, not just areas.
 Had no pains until 4+ years on lipitor.
 But - cholesterol went from 258 to 160."
"After almost 1 year on 10 mg/day, woke up one morning with right foot turned at right angle.
 Unable to straighten it and doctors unable to find a reason for it.
 Walked like that for about six months with increasing pain, especially in right thigh which felt.
 I'm so disillusioned with the drug companies and the FDA that I won't take anything my doctor recommends again.
 Lipitor has robbed me and my family of my former active self and I have no idea whether I will ever return to normal.
 Will try the CoQ10 idea and also physical therapy to try to realign everything from my hips down so I can move normally again.
 DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!
 IT IS NOT WORTH TRADING YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE FOR A LOWER CHOLESTEROL NUMBER!!!
 I too would like to join a class action suit, as I feel Pfizer was well aware of the damage this drug could do."
"aches and pain in both arms and shoulders and weakness in arms, especially left arm.
 Difficulty sleeping because of pain.
 Noticed a decrease in sexual desire, but don't know if Lipitor is to blame.
 Seems like the cure is worse than the disease.
 I will discontinue using lipitor and see if the pain goes away."
"Nagging muscle pain between and just below my shoulder blades, persistent fatigue, moderate insomnia, increasingly unable to focus or stay.
 I took 20mg/day for over four years before the totality of the side effects and their likely root cause finally hit me over the head.
 The adverse effects were insidiously gradual in their development which kept the alarm bells from going off sooner.
 Like many, I attributed each individual symptom to."
"I am amazed to find all the people who have experienced hip/knee/ankle pain, and back pain, after taking Lipitor.
 It never occured to me that the pain began around the time I started taking Lipitor, when I was 36.
 I started to feel 40 years older with all the pain I experienced.
 Stopped taking 2 days ago, hopefully will see improvement."
"Minor joint soreness, fatigue, have a hard time getting up in the morning.
 I used to hop out of bed ready to go.
 Right knee always sore and swollen.
 After 8 months, I have lowered my cholesterol to a safe level using Lipitor.
 I am also on Lopid to reduce Triglycerides.
 I take Glucosamine and Chondroitin to reduce joint soreness.
 seems to be working so far."
"Male, 67, while taking Lipitor for 5 months I experienced severe weight loss, muscle pain and loss of strength.
 AFTER coming off Lipitor, arthritis set in over entire body, which I have never suffered with before taking Lipitor.
 .
 Has anybody else experienced any arthritis AFTER coming off Lipitor?."
"One week after initiating therapy, developed syncope and hypertension.
 Primary care diagnosed and treated labyrinthitis.
 Subsequently developed irretractable lower back pain.
 Primary care treated with steroids.
 Other side effects included: weight gain, periorbital edema, fatigue, lack of libido, and detachment.
 My primary care never considered my symptoms may be associated with lipitor.
 I learned this only after reading about side effects in the PI and on the Internet."
"Dizzy.
 Lowered the cholesterol."
"aching joints.
 knees, shoulders, lower back, etc
 My doc took me off the Lipitor for two months.
 My joints quit aching and my cholestral went back up to 222."
"Muscle twitches and calf/toe cramps -also the.
 10mg taken
 The drug does lower the cholesterol reading but as I have also made diet changes and lifestyle changes - not sure if all due to drug or own common sense.
 I was not as aware of dangers as I am now and would not have taken it if not advised by MD.
 I aim to stop taking it."
"Was on Lipitor only 3 weeks and experienced very sore muscle pain in both shoulders, heart palpatations, sore knees, felt like a truck hit me.
 I'm only 56 and in good health otherwise.
 Stopped drug 1 week today (3/10) still have muscle pain.
 How long will this last????."
"severe muscle pain in my shoulders, numbness and tingling in my hands, wieght gain."
"extremly bad pains in hands,arms,shoulders.
 I took lipitor 10mg for only about two months,then cardiologist increased it to 20mg.
 In one week i started to get very bad pains in hands,arms and shoulders,at the same time freezing cold,like arms plunged into freezing water,then burning sensations.
 after being messed about by doctors not believing it was statins,i came across the website about side effects of statins,and all was revealed.
 I told my doctor i would never take statins again.
 I stopped them about eight weeks ago.
 but have gone from bad to worse in most terribe pain and no painkillers have any effect.
 During the night,it is even worse,last night I cried with pain.
 but there does not seem to be an answer.
 I now warn all my friends about statins and their side effects.
 I now wonder if the pain will ever go."
"HORRIBLE GAS AND CONSTIPATION.
 My trigycerides and cholesterol were all normal and healhty ranges, before taking Lipitor.
 But because of a high C-reactive protein level, I was prescribed Lipitor.
 After 3 months, My trigycerides and total cholesteral went down, even though they were fine to begin with, but my CRP level went UP!!!
 From 5.96 to 13.2!!
 Since treating the CRP levels was the initial purpose in prescribing me Lipitor, and since it did NOTHING to help these levels, I am therefore unsure if taking LIPITOR for high C-reactive protein levels is necessary, let alone effective.
 I can't deal with this gas much longer."
"Muscle and joint pain developed after approx 12 months.
 Began to spread to legs, buttocks, elbow.
 Stopped taking 10mg / day dosage on march 17th, will hope I start to feel positive results.
 Doctor had my on Lipitor and Tricor which seems to increase the chances of side effects.
 This is very scary, thought I had some type of bone cancer.
 Will never take this drug again."
"Eczema on hands and feet, rash on upper left torso, depression.
 Cholesterol at 312.
 Stopped taking after 6 days and depression lifted a few days later.
 Took 2 weeks for eczema outbreak to subside.
 Started taking an herbal cholesterol formula by Dr Sinatra and eating oatmeal everyday.
 8 weeks after stopping lipitor was retested and cholesterol dropped to 255.
 obviously not from lipitor but from changes in diet and supplements.
 doc want to try lower dosage but i am hesitant.
 i'm staying on new diet and supplements for now.
 retest in 30 days to see how effective.
 trying to avoid statins at all cost.
 doc is very insistant, almost as if he's getting a kickback.
 we'll see."
"Lipitor is the only prescription drug I take and have taken it for four years now.
 I have noticed I am gaining excess weight even though I am not eating more.
 My stomach is bloated, with excess gas (although could be the weight gain?).
 I also am experiencing increased memory loss, and fatigue, but then I rarely sleep well (due to night sweats) since I went through menopause ten years ago.
 I think some of my symptoms are related to being post menopausal rather than from the Lipitor."
After 4+ years I've now begun to experience joint pain and muscle weakness.
"within 3 days I experienced extreme muscle pain and weakness.
 I felt like I was walking though sludge.
 For the next 2 weeks I only wanted to sleep.
 I have no energy.
 My blood work indicates trouble with my liver.
 I have repeated the test every week since discontinuing the drug and it has not returned to normal yet.
 I am now experiencing edema-swelling of the hands, feet, legs etc I am taking lasiks trying to eleviate this.
 40 mg per day is not taking it away yet.
 It has been nearly 2 weeks since the swelling began.
 I am truly concerned about any permanent damage this medication my have caused.
 After only 3 10mg doses I have suffered a month of side effects!
 I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!
 If you are taking it now and experience anything unusual at all, contact your doctor immediately!
 I feared I might be over reacting to the muscle ache!
 I don't know where I'd be if I had continued taking lipitor beyond the 3 days!!!."
"SEVERE FATIGUE IN MY BODY AND TIREDNESS AND MUSCLE PAINS IN MY HIPS THAT CONTINUE TO THIS DAY AFTER BEING OFF THE DRUG FOR ALMOST A YEAR.
 DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!.
 I was put on this drug by my doctor for my somewhat high cholesterol.
 The next day, after starting this drug, I suddenly felt like I had aged to eighty years old overnight but did not connect it to starting Lipitor.
 Up until the start of this drug I felt that I was as young as I was in my twenties and wondered if this is how you might start feeling the affects of age, by waking up one morning and feeling all that age caught up with you and now you were older than your years.
 I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped.
 My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled.
 So I went off of Lipitor and within two months I was feeling normal again and even took a job with the post office where I walked five miles a day with no problem.
 I did not associate my getting better with my coming off Lipitor, unfortunately.
 Then I had an appointment with my doctor and he said I should have refilled that prescription by calling his office.
 So I did and the next day, after taking only one pill, I was eighty years old again.
 This time I did associate it with the start of Lipitor and then read the warnings the drug store gives you with meds and found that my symptoms were the same as what they warned against.
 I am not a hypochondriac and I never read those warnings so this was not a head thing.
 I immediately went off the drug but a year later I am still have the same eighty years old feeling and do not know that I will ever be normal again.
 I do not understand how just one pill can do that and this time I am not recovering like I did the first time.
 This has ruined my life and I would never have taken Lipitor if I knew what I know now and I am so sorry that I ever heard of this drug.
 This is so severe that I think taking it for even a short time can cause permanent damage.
 My doctor, when I told him of all this, wanted to change statins because he was still worried about my cholesterol.
 I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zetia, which he said was was less effective but was not a statin, which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor.
 He told me he was on Lipitor himself and that he had no problems but then said, well he did have neck pains that could have been a side affect, but that he had been on the drug two years before this developed.
 I told him of the information on this site that describes some people having that delayed reaction and I advised him to take himself off of this drug for a couple of weeks to see if the neck pains cleared up!
 I advise, DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!."
muscle aches in arms.
"Taking Lipitor 20 mg for 4 months now together with plavix, Zestril and Lopressor.
 Zestril and Lopressor caused many prblems so am on diovan instaed.
 Lipitor has recently started causing pain in back and behind the knee.
 Also developed hematuria .
 all urine test came back normal.
 Did anybody else experienced hematuria as a result of Lipitor use?.
 Am quitiing this medicine.
 very dangerous and should be used in extreme circumstances."
"day two of taking the product, and I have pain and tingling in my fingers as well as a major sharp pain in the side, which could be of of many things including simply gas - a common problem as reported here.
 Way too early to post something more constructive, but I will come back later.
 Thanks to all posters here - big relief from your reports to know this is not unusual."
"I female, 5 feet 7 and a half inches tall, 117 lbs.
 I do not smoke and have never smoked.
 I do not have high blood pressure, nor have I ever had it.
 I am not diabetic.
 I am 45 and a half years old and was on 20 mg of Lipitor due to genetically high LDL for a period of seven months.
 At that point, I started having terrible, migratory joint pain all over my body that was very distinct and pronounced.
 I also had disabling fatigue and flu-like malaise.
 Some nights I would go to bed at 6 pm and not get up until 8 or 9 the next morning.
 I was quite ill.
 My doctor did tons of lab work to rule out things like rheumatoid arthriitis, lupus, Lyme disease and active parvovirus infection.
 These all came back NEGATIVE.
 Finally, I was taken off Lipitor to see if the drug had anything to do with my symptoms.
 Within 72 hours I noted an improvement; within seven days, the symptoms were completely gone and I was restored to health.
 I will not ever take Lipitor again as I believe it is liver-toxic and slowly poisons the patient.
 It did a great job of lowering my LDL (173 down to 60).
 My total cholesterol went from 238 down to 143.
 However, it nearly killed me in the process and I believe it is almost like a slow-acting poison."
"Didn't associate my problems with Lipitor until reading this web site.
 I've been on Lipitor for about 7 mos.
 Have had problems with my hips and knees in the past but just within the last year I've been experiencing spasms in upper thighs, especially after doing anything physical.
 Now I have a dr. apptmt. in a few days because my right knee is so painful I can't even bend it!
 It hurts to get up in the morning, get out of a chair, go up stairs.
 Also, I have had operations on my right foot a few years ago, but now it hurts almost as much if not more.
 The bottom of my foot is extremely tender as are my calves.
 The Lipitor did lower my cholesteral wonderfully; but I'm extremely concerned that this may be what my problems are coming from.
 Hopefully, the dr. will tell me more this week."
"My EKG was not good and a blood test also indicated a problem.
 I was sent for a stress test which I failed, and was sent to a heart doctor.
 I had no other symptoms of heart problems, but I had high blood pressure and overweight.
 So lipitor was prescribed to lessen likelihood of partial blockage to my heart.
 Cholesterol levels are terrific now and I may be sent for another stress test next month.
 I feel great on Lipitor but could not take Zocor(side effects)."
"Severe elbow, arm and shoulder pain.
 It's just a little white pill, this can't be causing all of my pain.
 Boy was I wrong, this pill has caused me so much grief.
 I couldn't even watch TV with my family as the pain in my arms and shoulder drove me to my bed.
 I felt so old and scared that the rest of my life would be pain filled.
 One week ago I ran out of lipitor and after a few days found that my arm & elbow pain subsided.
 Why isn't this widely known?
 I'm angry and also sad, sad that I've wasted all this time and angry that the drug companies are getting richer by the second."
"Headaches,body aches,joint stiffness,bloating,excessive gas,cramping,irritability.
 I took it for about 3 weeks before I started feeling any side effects.
 I didn't realize this was the cause until I researched a little to see what side effects had been encountered.
 It was pretty shocking when I found out I was suffering from half of those listed.
 And I just thought I had a."
"General fatigue, aches and pains for years.
 Thought it was menopause.
 But recently--severe swolen/inflamation of the fingers/hands and wrist pain.
 Have suffered with geneal aches and pains for years thinking very similar to alot of you, that it was just my age and I had to accept it!
 I have been suffering with severe swolen/inflamation of the fingers/hand & wrist pain for 8 months and attributed it to new blood pressure medicine or arthritis; however, after going off the new blood pressure meds for 5 weeks, I have noticed no remarkable change and have had blood work and x-rays indicating NO arthritis.
 But now after finding this site, I'm wondering if it has been the Lipitor all along all of a sudden after taking it for 7.5 years.
 I am discontinuing the Lipitor immediately to see if I can find any change and relief.
 I agree with so many of you in saying that no cholesterol lowering drug is worth this kind of result!
 Thank you everyone for taking the time to write so we aren't prisoners to just our doctor's advice!."
"Aching weakness in legs back and shoulders.
 Side effects subsided after lipitor stopped.
 The drug is toxic and will probably kill you before the high cholesterol will."
"Body aches (knees, back and especially chest) which increased with time, lethargic, short term memory lacking, concentration is worse than ever.
 Worked wonders for my cholesterol but ruined everything else.
 I kept telling my doctor about the body aches but he always blamed it on something else.
 stress, anxiety, lack of exercise.
 I'm still on the lipitor but I'm contacting my doctor to try another cholesterol med.
 I'm glad I came across this site."
"Hair loss (Diffuse Alopecia), hair thinning.
 I have had type 1 diabetes for 21 years.
 My blood sugar control has always been good (Hemoglobin A1C tests always below 6%).
 I have a healthy diet and a normal weight.
 My Thyroid function is normal.
 I have been taking, Olmetec(olmesartan), Istin(amlodipine) and Lipitor(atorvastatin).
 Since taking Lipitor my hair has started falling out at an alarming rate.
 The thinning is most pronounced at the back and sides of my head so it's not conventional male pattern baldness.
 Lipitor has certainly lowered by cholesterol but I've stopped taking it after 9 months.
 The stress caused by losing my hair in this way will probably do me more harm than having high cholesterol."
very bad pain in my muscles.
"I am 51 years and have had acne breakouts on my face and neck.
 SEVERE leg and foot pains, depression, balance and memeory problems.
 Feel as if I was 90 years old.
 Pain first thing in the morning trying to walk improves as day wears on.
 Several x-rays, MRI's, cat scans.
 R/O MS.
 I quit taking four days ago and already feel better.
 Next dr's appt next week and I will inform Dr I WILL NOT take this RX again!."
"A good side effect - I take the lipitor at night because my husband had heard it works better taken at night.
 right away I was falling asleep more easily and sleeping through the night.
 I thought it was just me till I saw the notes here about tiredeness.
 I'm not tired during the day."
"Fuzzy, dizzy, light-headedness feeling I've never had before.
 Low grade headache goes with it.
 Mild insomnia.
 Poor concentration, noise intolerance.
 I rarely get headaches.
 Started getting them a while back, never put 2 and 2 together.
 Saw an internist and 2 neurolgists, had MRI, MRA, all showing nothing.
 Stopped Lipitor 2 weeks ago, with 40% reduction in severity but still waiting for it to go away.
 Not many here have posted follow-up.
 Because so many people take Lipitor, and headaches, etc are so coommon, what we need is to show that there is an increased incidence of side effects like these compared to those not taking Lipitor, AND that the side effects go away once stopping it.
 I will re-post when either 3 months goes by or the side effects disappear, whichever is 1st.
 I suspect that it will take at least a few more weeks, before the build-up effects of this mess can be cleared from my brain."
"Severe back pain.
 Leg,finger and feet joint pain similar to arthritis.
 Planta fasciitis similarities.
 Big weight gain in stomach area.
 I am 55 and never felt so old in my life!.
 went down to 10 mlg after complaining about back pain.
 Doctor refuses to believe it is the medication causing the pain."
"I've experienced tennis elbow and plantar fasciatis before, so I can't necessarily blame Lipitor.
 I have also noticed slight neck pain, but that could have other causes like my varied exercise routine.
 It has sharply reduced my cholesterol level."
"back ache, dizziness, leg cramps on exercise walk.
 Been on it 10 days; started Diovan 4 days ago.
 Side effects really kicked in over the last day or so.
 Don't which is the culprit since similar side effects are attributed to Diovan.
 any insights?."
"pain in both legs, unable to climb stairs for eight months,unable to stand for any time with out extrem pain in knee joints.
 When I notified the prescribing doctor ther was a problem, he eventualy said that there is a problem with the medication and the pain in the legs should subside in eight or nine weeks.
 It finaly took fifteen weeks and left me with two failed knee joits that were perfect before taking the medication.
 The product should be removed from the market for further evaluation."
"After approx 5 years of Lipitor, I have been experiencing severe pains in my arms.
 Cardiologist suggested coming off Lipitor to see if this was the problem.
 Off 2 weeks now and definitely better, almost gone.
 Now wondering about statin induced myopathy.
 Also take Cozaar for high BP and Bisoprolol for heart rythm.
 Tiredness exists.
 always put that down to the stresses of life."
"Within a week or two of taking the prescribe dose, I began developing something I never had before: eczema.
 It became progressively worse, and by the end of the first month had created a massive triangular rash on my forehead, as well as a patch on one cheek.
 The skin was very red and rough, and made public life miserable and embarassing.
 I stopped taking Lipitor and the rash cleared up greatly, but has NEVER gone away completly, flaring up slightly from time to time, but not nearly as bad as it was during dosing with Lipitor.
 I was not taking any other medications at the time, and never had eczema before.
 The anti-lipid effect of Lipitor was unusually strong in my case, causing my CHO to drop below 90 (from a baseline of over 200).
 by the end of the first 2 weeks of dosing, my physician had me cutting the smallest dose tablet in half to be taken once a day.
 Even so, the rash continued to enlarge and get worse, so I was forced to stop taking the Lipitor."
"rashes - until I took it at night.
 then after the first year - joint pains - until I switched to 3 times a week, still at night."
"Could not get to sleep, then slept for 3 to 4 hours and was not rested.
 Diarrhea was constant and I didn't feel right.
 My body tells me when something is not good for me and I stopped taking it after 5 days.
 Strange how the highest numbers for liking the drug, Lipitor, are listed first.
 Who backs this website?."
"Within 1 month time developed severe depression, inability to pull myself from bed, headaches everyday, and felt like I was coming down with flu.
 I will never take statins again.
 My doctor referenced Lipitor as a."
"My husband was on 10 mg for several years.
 increasing muscle pain in legs, right hip, depression.
 Went to 20 mgs and had heart palpitations and more severe pain.
 Thank, God, we went on a 10-day vacation.
 He forgot his Lipitor and pain decreased dramatically.
 We were able to make the connection.
 I want to shoot his doctor.
 When we returned from vaction he tried to start his dose and experienced flu-like symtoms and all-over muscle pain.
 Get off of it if you can."
"Abdominal pain, headaches, diarrea, nausea, heartburn, weakness, muscle pain, flu symptoms, bad taste in mouth to the point I could not eat, Where do I stop, there were so many.
 For me I believe that this drug is a poison.
 My doctor gave me a low 10mg. dose so it took several months of slowly getting sick to be almost incapacitated.
 Do yourself a favor, its called diet."
"My wife and I bo,th shared weakness in legs, pain in legs, hair losss, Rashes, itchy when I went to sit down instead of sitng normaly I would almost fall down in the chair no control no strength, upon getting up I had to hold on to something to get up.
 No stopping action going down hill, arms, hands, have little or no grip, I am on 20 mgs, my wife 10,,, we have stopped as of this date.
 I(male) have been on Lipitor for almost 3 yrs, I had open heart surgery 3 yrs ago and since then Ive been on it, My wife gets burning sensations, pains in her back, frequent urination(both of us) and a hard time sleeping.
 Its bad news."
"Weight gain, extreme muscle aches and fatigue, alternating constipation and diarrhea, more frequent asthma flare-ups, insomnia, weird dreams.
 I had to walk with a cane because I was so weak and ached all over, especially in legs.
 My husband and I took ourselves off this medication 10 days ago.
 I can't tell you how much better we both feel off Lipitor.
 I sleep better, don't need to use my cane, and can bend and move better after just 10 days off the medicine.
 DON'T TAKE LIPITOR--try garlique or a natural remedy.
 Lipitor hurts more than it helps."
"EXTREME PAIN IN NECK AND SHOULDERS FOR THREE WEEKS, MEMORY LOSS, INABILITY TO FUNCTION, ZONED OUT, SICK TO MY STOMACH.
 VERY SCAREY DRUG."
"Extreme fatigue, headaches, cramping in both calves, memory problems, like Im in a fog all the time.
 Dr has taken me off the drug.
 Previously I have taken ZOCOR and MEVACOR with similar results, but not has pronounced as with LIPITOR.
 Find another way to reduce blood cholesterol."
"Type II diabetic, formerly on oral medication but converted to insulin injections twice daily after bypass surgery.
 Prescribed Lipitor 40 mg/day although TC was below 200 mcg/dl.
 After taking drug for several months, I experienced progressive unsteasiness walking & could not stand in one place for more than a few seconds without loss of balance.
 Intermittent acute pain in both feet, for which I was prescribed Neurontin.
 Also experienced weakness in legs and knees causing some limping as well as numbness in fingers & general weakness in hands (difficulty removing gas cap on car).
 After accidentally running out of Lipitor, I noticed a significant improvement in balance within 2-3 days.
 Also found that blood glucose level dropped significantly both AM and PM after halting Lipitor.
 I also discontinued Neurontin and began taking coenzyme Q10 120 mg/day.
 I have researched Lipitor and other statin drug side effects on internet and will no longer take Lipitor or any statin drugs.
 Feel much better after 30 days statin-free."
"Gradually declining physical ability.
 Joint pain (elbows!), buzzing left leg (I thought my cell phone was in my pocket on vibrate!).
 Occasional loss of balance, MEMORY LOSS!, blurred vision.
 Dropped total Cholesterol from 245 to 185.
 GREAT SITE!
 I'm appalled at the state of the cholesterol war.
 My HDL has always been in the 60's which put me at a ratio of 4.0 or better.
 Dr.'s used to say that was all that mattered.
 NOW, my new Dr prescribes Lipitor as my numbers are 'alarming'.
 As an ex-olympic athlete, I still compete at a Masters level at age 43 and enjoy being a good athlete.
 I have a high tolerance for pain, so the pain wasn't an issue, but I feel like I've aged 20 years!
 I've slowed down considerably and don't have the tolerance I once did.
 My short-term memory disappeared.
 Not that I would have noticed, but my wife was getting increasingly mad at my apparent lack of attention!
 I'm going off this drug and trying the vitamin C approach.
 Else, the heck with it.
 Through exercise, I'll keep my HDL high and work on the ratio rule.
 I'm convinced this drug will kill me before any possible heart disease!."
"My fingers swelled up and hurt.
 I thought I had gout or arthritis.
 My joints in my hands hurt.
 My knee hurt.
 It hurt to bend my knee.
 I took 10 mg. each day for 120 days.
 I stopped taking lipitor now for 40 days and joint pain is slowly improving and not as bad.
 I have lost trust in most doctors.
 they are only doing what they know, which is very little.
 there are natural remedies, such as niacin, walnuts, flaxseed, oat bran, just to name a few."
"my partner is currently taking this medication liptor, he also takes high blood pressure medication, my reason for initally looking for side effects of liptor was because of my partners decreased libido and to see if there is a connection between this and the medication, however i noticed a small number of people are suffering in this way, i cannot believe the amount of things that are causing such a big problem for so many people taking this drug, my partner is normally very muscular as works out twice a week and has done for years, but over the last 6mths or so seems to have lost a lot of muscle and replacedit with fat, especially around the midrif, he also suffers from regular dioreaha and muscle pain in back and just below shoulder blades, very often also suffers from headaches, doesnt sleep very well at night at all,also gets tired a lot , my partner isnt aware of this website but i will be definetly showing this to him and advising him to perhaps stop taking this medication for a few weeks to see what the difference is , so glad to have found this site.
 my partner is 40."
"EXCRUCIATING PAIN IN SHOULDERS AND NECK, MEMORY LOSS, FELT JUST STRANGE.
 STARTED TAKING LIPITOR 20 MG 4 YEARS AGO, DR UPPED IT TO 40 MG 5 MONTHS AGO.
 TOOK ME ALL THIS TIME AND THIS RATING BOARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS REALLY WRONG WITH ME.
 DR KEPT TELLING ME I WAS DEPRESSED.
 WHO WOULDN'T BE WITH THIS HIDEOUS CONSTANT PAIN?
 TOOK MYSELF OFF OF THE LIPITOR 7 DAYS AGO AND FEELING MUCH BETTER.
 WHEN I WENT TO DR WITH THIS HE SAID."
"Cramps in calves several times a day.
 Legs feel tired and swollen.
 Neck and shoulders ache and are sore all the time.
 I am going off of it."
"I have been complaining to a variety of doctors about severe muscle cramping that has been affecting me for the past three years, which started upon waking one morning with what felt like a shark biting into my right calf.
 I'd been taking Zocor for years and had recently been switched to Lipitor.
 Not one of the doctors once mentioned the statin as a possible cause of this problem.
 I wake up each morning feeling paralyzed all over my body.
 as if I have rigor mortis and am being resurrected from death (no exaggeration).
 Thanks for this website and to all you people who have shared your experiences of Lipitor.
 I finally have my answer!!! .
 This drug has been destroying every aspect of my life.
 physical and psychological.
 It's destroyed my self-confidence, my sex life, my business.
 And now it looks and feels like the medical establishment is keeping it all a dirty little secret for the sake of the income that statins generate.
 I'd rather have died outright from a heart attack than suffer as I have the past three years.
 And, reading this website, I can find a little comfort in knowing that I am not alone with this maddening array of weird symptoms.
 Thank you!
 Thank you!!!
 You may have saved my life !!!."
"depression, sleeplessness, muscle weakness.

"right hand tremor, affected gait--small steps, hunched over position, slowness in movement,.
 I think lipitor therapy of 4+ yrs cauased parkinson's diagnosis.
 i wonder if there is a genetic component related to this--if some people with genetic variability suffered an interaction with statin (as the environmental agent) to produce this neurodegenerative disease.
 however rarely this occurs, given taht there are millions of people taking this class of drugs, if it is due to genetic variability, there could be enormous numbers of people suffering from neuro symptoms.
 i have heard from people who think their amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is due to statins, and from people who think their parkinson/s is due to statins.
 others have questioned the diagnosis of alzheimer's and the use of aa statin.
 given taht these 3 neurodegenerative diseases are thought to be due to the same underlying molecular pathology, it is not a far fetched question--do statins indue neurodegenerative diseases in susceptible individuals?????."
"pain in upper right arm, could not sleep on it or move it behind my back.
 the drug has worked very well to resuce my cholesterol rating 5 however the pain in my arm and shoulder has reduced within 2 days of stopping the drug Rating 1 .
 therefore overal rating 3."

 No smoking or drinking and work daily.
 Wt is 15 lbs more than it should be.
 Cholesterol has been high for years despite diet.
 Taking 40mg daily for 1 year, took 20mg previously.
 Lately I realized everything hurts.
 It crept up on me.
 I am an RN and still did not put it together until this week when I decided something is not right.
 When the aches and pains were mild I thought it was arthritis or too much activity.
 Stopped the Lipitor and the generalized aches and pains are fading after just 3 days.
 Will explore other options but these drugs have not been around long enough to confirm long term effects.
 Looking at this site, I will begin to ask my patients that are on statins about their history."
"I had an extreme reaction - tunnel vision, vertigo, tingling and numbness (hands, legs, face), complete weakness in the right side of my body including loss of strength, and what I term as complete body flushes (like a hot flash without the hot).
 I thought for sure that I was having a stroke.
 The hospital did a CT scan, MRI, MRA, Echocardiogram, Doppler of the Carotids, X-rays, and first termed it a TIA.
 But since that time the doctors have backed down from that diagnosis.
 A week later I had several (22) episodes of the body flushes (within a 5 hour period) which sent me back to the hospital.
 After several doctors, they are saying now that it was probably caused by the Lipitor.
 I am not taking it any more and have not had any episodes for 10 days.
 This was after only taking the Lipitor for 21 days.
 The only good thing that came from all of this hospitilization was that they did find a brain aneurysm which I am having taken care of by a."

"I have never been so miserable in my life.
 Started out with severe back spasms, then had intense pain in my knees and spasms all throughout my legs.
 Weakness in my right arm.
 The worst of all was feeling like I was walking through waist-deep mud, I simply could not walk.
 Extreme anxiety as well.
 I had no idea what an evil poison this is.
 My doctor never told me any of the side effects but since then I have learned of so many people with the same problems.
 Taking 200 mg/day of COQ10 has helped immensely as well as the potassium of bananas."
"blinding headaches, neck and shoulder pain.
 Memory loss and at times find it difficult to work.
 severe fatigue with aches and pains.
 Prior to taking this medication I felt great and look forward to getting back to my old self again.
 I have been off lipitor for almost 2 weeks and still feel pretty lousy."
"Muscle pain.
 Severe joint pain in the shoulders and knees.
 Pain and cramping in my hands and lower legs.
 Numbness in all of my finger tips and toes.
 Wake up on and off all night long due to numbness in my hands and pain in shoulders some nights worse than others.
 I've been off lipitor since 7/1/04 and the muscle pain is gone and my knees are almost back to my norm.
 Both of my shoulders are still very messed up.
 Have constint shoulder pain more in the left than the right.
 Still have finger and hand numbness on and off all day and night.
 Worse at night.
 But even these pains are a lot less now then they were while on lipitor.
 I'm hoping that there is not any perminent damage.
 While first taking lipitor and I noticed these changes I told my doctor and he told me that this had nothing to do with the lipitor.
 It was just age."
"Severe pain in both calfs and thighs.
 I became unable to lift my legs to put on my pants or even get in the car.
 This developed after being on the Lipitor for about 5 years.
 I was on 10 mg and complained about discomfort in my legs but my cardiologist just said it was old age and even upped my dose to 20 mg.
 That really made things a lot worst and now I just stopped it and within 24 hours could see an improvement.
 Incidently I am a physician and was aware of the myalgia with Lipitor but I suspect it is much worst than the drug company would have you believe.
 This is really a very toxic drug and should be used with caution.
 This is a drug which is very effective in lowering cholesterol but also affects many metabolic pathways in the body and is potentially dangerous."
"Over the course of the past year I've experienced, short term memory loss, extreme fatigue,joint pain, especially in my knees.
 I also had reflux, that until I found this site, thought it was unrelated.
 Doc put me on Lipitor, when I complained that Tricor was making me tired.
 Lipitor was 10X WORSE !!!.
 I WILL NEVER TAKE ANY STATIN EVER AGAIN !!
 Since I found this site--I thought all the symptoms were caused by other things.
 Now I know that Tricor started the problems, Lipitor made them much worse.
 NATURAL SUPPLEMENTS ARE THE WAY TO GO !!
 Just Google Natural Alternatives for Lipitor .
 I've been off this killer drug for 6 weeks, and feel great !!
 No fatigue, memory is back, knees still hurt, but hopefully, they rebound too.
 Doctor is PISSED-----I'M THRILLED !!!."

"after taking the drug for several years, I developed one of the supposedly rare side effects .
 muscle disintegration/degeneration .
 fortuntately when I experienced fatigue and muscle/joint pain, I remembered some of the warnings I had read when I first started taking the drug .
 My doctor ordered a blood test when I told him of my symptoms and concerns and it revealed a grossly excessive amount of muscle tissue in my blood .
 I haven't taken it since .
 after I stopped taking Lipitor, I felt normal about three weeks later ."
"The last two years I have had severe pain in my feet and legs with a definite decrease in muscle strength.
 have spent a fortune on orthodics and shoes.
 I take a very small amount because I have always been hyper sensitive to drugs.
 I am now convinced it IS the Lipitor and am going to stop immediately as a test.
 It definitely lowers cholesterol.

 The research is still out though."

 diuretics taken to relieve edema caused cholesterol to go higher and M.D. recommended more Lipitor which made the edema worse and so on; got off that downward spiral 2 months ago and cholesterol went right back up to 300+ within a week but I'll take my chances and try to find some way other than statins so I can get some quality of life back."
"I am a Gym Junky, pretty athletic, attend 4 times a week.

 loss of muscle strenth, mainly calves.
 Have stopped taking lipitor, changed my diet, and life is slowly getting back to normal.
 awful drug.
 Maybe the people not affected by Lipitor lead a non physical life or do not have any muscle, and therefor do not notice the effects.????.
 Did a great job in lowering colestrol.
 down to 2.7 ."
"After three months on Lipitor, I started to feel like an airhead -- slightly dizzy virtually all the time and frequently unable to think clearly.
 I actually started to wonder if I were developing early Alzheimer's (I'm 58).
 After five months, I developed severe pain in my thighs and knees and I'm exhausted all the time.
 So far my blood tests have been normal, but now that I've read these posts, I'm going to stop taking Lipitor.
 It did lower my total cholesterol from 235 to 200."
"Joint and Muscle Pain / Stiffness.
 I took 20 mg for 9 years and I told numerous physicians about my pain and stiffness and was told that I had arthritis and to keep taking it.
 I left it at home by accident when we went on vacation and within 3 days, the pain in my legs began to go away.
 After 2 weeks I knew it was a very dangerous medication.
 I went to my new physician and he wanted me to try Pravachol.
 Afer 4 days on it, I was in a fog and thought I had the flu.
 I have been off it for just 36 hours and feel better.
 I am an RN and should have known that I was experiencing side effects with Lipitor, but you listen to your Doctor because you trust him.
 I now tell my patients to trust what their bodies are telling them.
 Statins can't be good for anyone but the drug companies!!!!!!!!!!
 They keep lowering the recommended levels so that almost everyone is considered to have high cholesterol.
 If someone is 30 and on this for 30 or 40 years there is not telling what the long term effects will be.
 And a mi."
"After 1 year on Lipitor, I experienced severe pain in both hips & legs, would wake up with so much pain at night that I would get out of bed for relief.
 Even after 3 months of nonuse, I still have stiffness, weakness & pain in both legs/ hips, especially right side & now limp.
 I have started physical therapy, massage theraphy & pain medicine."
"No significant side effects.
 Slight muscle aches in my back in the morning when I first started taking it, but that passed with time.

 but strong improvement since quit taking the poison."
"2 years with no problems, then toe neuropathy for two years now and other foot problems because of this I assume.
 I stopped Lipitor after taking it for 2 years and toe neuropathy started.
 I also had stomach problems and pain.
 After stopping Lipitor, I thought my heart would jump out of my chest, but now stomach and heart are both OK - Feet are terrible thanks to Lipitor.
 I know many others that have had problems with Lipitor - feet and legs - and had to stop.
 All my blood test were normal.
 I weigh 114 and 5'2 .
 Hike, play golf and keep busy.
 It is a terrible drug and should be off the market."
"It concerns me that someone else is recommending SIMVISTATIN as an alternative to LIPITOR.
 Up until 3 weeks ago I was taking LIPEX which is SIMVISTATIN - it reduced my cholesterol very satisfactorily.
 However - over time, the following symptoms developed - pain in hips cannot walk even a short distance due to pain.
 Legs felt like they had run a marathon!
 Deep bruising - I thought I was just being clumsy.
 Joint pain in spine, hips and elbows.
 Exhaustion.
 A colleague asked if I was on cholesterol medication and informed me there could be a connection - I found this website - amazed at all the similarities to me - I thought I was going MAD!!!
 I came of LIPEX 3 weeks ago, muscles feel better, energy levels picking up, but hip pain still throbbing.
 I also felt like an old woman, I have over the years been to physiotherapists and chiropractors who did not know what to do - recently diagnosed with bursitis in the hips had 2 cortizone injections - still suffering severe hip pain and cannot walk more than 5 yards.
 Doctor agreed I could be having severe side effects of STATIN drug - has insisted I need my cholesterol attended to - has now put me on BEZALIP (no relation to STATINS so I am told) I haven't filled the script yet - need to do more research.
 My heart goes out to all of you!."
"Achilles peritendonitis and sore ankles, knees and fingers.
 Stiffness was aggravated by rest and better with activity.
 After sitting for 15 minutes, particularly with feet elevated, and then getting up to walk, my gait was like someone who could barely walk.
 Have stopped taking Lipitor and symptoms seem to be subsiding.
 Lipitor worked great lowering cholesterol but the side effects are not worth the benefit."

"feeling in a fog, memory problems; muscle weakness in mouth area causing speech difficulties like pronunciation, and chewing/swallowing difficulties like biting my tongue and inside my cheek; muscle weakness in my right hand causing me to lose grip and drop things; balance problems when turning around or standing to walking movements.
 I was not informed by my doctor to look out for these symptoms, in fact she did not feel they were connected to the Lipitor.
 I know my body and this is not me.
 I am going to stop and see what happens."
"Ok for a while but then started having severe leg muscle pains to point could not sleep.
 After 3 days of not taking it, most leg pain went away.
 Hopefully joint pain will eventually go away."
"After taking 40 mg/day of Lipitor for a couple of years, I started to notice foot pain, diagnosed as a neuroma in the right foot, then a hammer toe, then left heel pain.
 I didn't connect this with Lipitor and continued to take it.
 I saw a podiatrist who made no mention of the connection between foot pain and statins.
 One day a pharmacist told my husband that there was a huge connection between taking statins and foot pain.
 I dc'd Lipitor 6 mos. ago, and my foot pain improved a lot, but I still have some daily pain and discomfort when I walk.
 My cholesterol numbers have shot up, but I won't take statins again.
 I'm afraid I'll become a cripple.
 I'll pay more attn. to diet & exercise, try Vit. C and prescription Niacin.
 If you have foot pain while on a statin, assume a connection, and assume that family physicians and podiatrists are largely unaware of this connection."
"After using Lipitor for 2.5 years, I decided to stop two weeks ago because of severe pain in my left arm.
 I am left handed and recently couldn't normally do my job.
 Twice I told my doctor about pain in my arm and he didn't take that seriously, ignoring my complaint.
 After two weeks of not taking Lipitor my arm almost recovered and I can work without any pain or any problem.
 It started a long time ago with tingling in my arms, they were often fall asleep, usually when I wake up in the morning.
 From month to month pain was worst until I almost lost all strength and couldn't use my arm.
 Anyway, I think I made a good decision by not using Lipitor anymore (my doctor will be mad at me).
 I will try with natural supplements and more exercising.
 I am very ""anxious"" about medication that can cause myopathy, liver damage or cancer.

"Took 10 mg. for two years with no problems, then started to have burning,numb feet in toe area - both feet.
 Also, had discomfort in right side upper and lower of stomach area.
 After assorted blood tests which were all normal, read an article regarding neurophathy and statins drugs.
 Stopped the Lipitor and slowly the stomach discomfort went away, but two years later my feet are still a mess.
 Would not take this or any other statin drug."
"Severe headache, joint and muscle pain, anorexia, extreme gas, memory loss, mood swings.
 I had a LAD artery 100% blocked a couple years ago and suffered a miocardial infarction.
 The pain was unbearable and the pain from the headache Lipitor caused was WORSE!
 I've taken Zocor, Crestor and had similar problems with side effects, but i thought Lipitor was going to cause my death.
 NEVER again!."
severe leg pains.
"A few years after the dosage was raised to 40 mg, I began to have a sharp pain in the ball of my right foot, diagnosed as a neuroma.
 (It seemed more like metatarsalgia to me.)
 Then the left foot started hurting also.
 I nearly stopped walking for 6 months, hoping to get better to avoid surgery.
 I stopped Lipitor as an experiment, and after 3 days the pain changed completely.
 It began to heal after that.
 Every week since has been a marked improvement.
 After 7 weeks, it's nearly healed.
 I can again hike for miles without the horrible pain I experienced for over 6 months while taking this drug.
 Lipitor did control cholesterol, but isn't it really inflamation causing heart disease and stroke, and not the cholesterol?
 Is everyone barking up the wrong tree here?
 And what is the price of all the weird side effects no one can recognize?."
"severe pain and severe limitation in movement in upper arm muscles; memory deficits and mental fogginess; worsening cataract; parkinson's-type tremor in left hand.
 Two weeks after discontinuing mevacor, the muscle pain was very much improved (full range of motion took a year to recover); tremor disappeared; vision in eye awaiting cataract surgery improved to pre-Mevacor level (my eye surgeon said that he had seen existing cataracts made more severe by statins in other patients as well); noticed distinct improvement mental function in two weeks.
 There have been reports of worsening of gum disease as well, which I had had and which did improve.
 If you read the research carefully, there is reason to believe that higher levels of cholesterol are associated with lower overall mortality rather than higher, especially in older women.
 Cholesterol is an important part of brain tissue and many essential biochemicals, and that serum cholesterol levels do not correlate well with arterial placque."

 things improved slowly but immediately after going off the drug,it has been almost 7 months and am progressing slowly still,feel like i have long term damage,but in better shape in many respects than i have been in 5 years,it did a slow terrable number on me.
 i am trying to forgive them but am not getting far on that front,having interesting pleasant fantacies on that front needless to say i do not wish them well.

"For as long as I could remember I've always had perfect cholesterol (from a percentage perspective anyway).
 It's always been right around 120/120.
 For what ever reason my LDL shot up to 175 so a (not my normal one) Dr just prescribed me Lipitor.
 I didn't notice any problems for just over 2 months then all of a sudden one day I stared feeling horrible like a severe flu just hit me.
 For the next few days I couldn't get enough sleep I was incredibly week and had pains throughout my upper body.
 I saw my regular Dr and decided to stop taking the drug, she also drew blood.
 Luckily most of the tests came back normal but there was a small spike in something with my liver which was normal before.
 My Cholesterol was LDL 95 HDL 109 (which I thought it is advertised to raise?) and my triglycerides were great as well.
 I can't say that the drug doesn't work but compared to how I feel it's not with it and I'll never take it again.
 I've been off it for 3 days now and only feel slightly bett."

"hair loss, weight gain, muscle pain.
 After suffering form real bad side effects (hair loss, weight gain, blurred vision) I decided to stop all the chemicals.
 I am fed up with all those medications which ALL induce side effects, for which your doctor will prescribe more and more medications.
 That is when hell starts.
 My hair was falling off, I could not lose weight even exercising and eating healthy food.
 When I stopped Lipitor, my hair stopped falling immediately and I lost 4 lbs the 1st week, without doing anything different.
 You completely destroy your metabolism absorbing chemicals.
 Now I stopped all that and I am going the NATURAL way with good results.
 I recommend acupuncture, homeopathy, natural supplements (I highly recommend Apple Cider Vinegar and raw honey, those made my blood pressure go down by 30 points!), good nutrition and exercise are much better and you will not enrich those pharmaceutical companies which are after your money, just trying to erase the symptoms but NOT the cause.
 Take charge!
 It is time."
"fluids pooling in my lower extremeties - especially my feet, general muscle soreness.
 I take several meds for rheumatoid arthritis and none of these medications have affected me in this way.
 My rheumatology office suggested I check with my PCP immidiately."
"Most of the side effects everyone else has: weak legs, muscle and back soreness, ears ringing, feel bad, all usually in the mornings.
 However, it lowered my cholesterol, tryglycerides, and blood pressure, along with a lot of exercising.
 I had by-pass surgery in 1986, angioplasty in the mid 90's, started on Zocor, then my doctor switched me to Lipitor and have not had to have either since I started on the statins.
 (started with 20mg. then 40mg., and now 80mg.)
 Its not perfect, but it keeps me alive.
 I am now 65 and I thank God every single day for my doctor and my medicine.
 I just gut it up and make my self jog a mile and walk a mile 4-5 times a week, pain or no pain.
 I have lived to see my grandchildren and two great grandchildren.
 Life is good.
 Think positive!."

 It was scary trying to make sure I had proper observation and not over-reaction because of the symptoms.
 I had to slow people down several times.
 Now convinced it would have had serious health risks for me had I even tried taking a second pill the next day or even continuing taking them.
 It took a while (months) before I started to feel normal again."
"Indigestion - never had it before and stopped when I stopped taking the statin.
 Chest pains waking me up at night - never had it before and stopped when I stopped taking the statin.
 Neuropothy in right hand & arm - never had it before and stopped when I stopped taking the statin.
 .
 I believe it is totally unnecessary for healthy people.
 We NEED cholesterol.
 In trying to reduce it, statins stop a whole cascade of addditional enzymes and proteins that are absolutely necessary for healthy bodies.
 It took three years of statins (2 on Zocor then 1 one on Lipitor) at 40mg per day to finally cause the above reactions to the destruction the stains were doing to my body."
"extreme constant pain, legs, hips, fuzzy headed, muscle loss, possible permanent damage.
 I am totally convinced this stuff is dangerous, it does lower cholesterol, but to what end?
 Found more natural fix which is more effective, excellent results, better quality of life, and better health overall.
 Blood test was 8.06 total, now 3.05 without using Lipitor!
 Had around 25 angina attacks per week, now 0.
 Was totally disabled, now active."
"severe pain in buttocks and left leg Sciatica like symptoms.
 I don't know if it helped anything.
 Felt no difference except sudden onset of pain after one month.
 Couldn't sleep."
"Sudden knee pain 2 week into it, horriable crippeling pain hit both knees at same moment, progressed to odd painful, lumpy swelling on both feet in same place on each and a sudden horriable grabbing pain in one ankle, gas, indigestion, acid reflux, no energy, confusion, stumbeling, vertigo, memory loss, frequent sudden urges to go pee that came out with a force that sprayed everywhere.
 (Off of it I now have to force it out).
 Getting off cleared most up but woke up every morning with horriable pain in a different joint making it useless until it passed days later and suddenly landed in right shoulder.
 MRI shows arthritis, tendonitis and burscitis when there was never any problems in that shoulder before.
 Been suffering with that for almost a year.
 Sudden grabbing pain in ankle comes and goes.
 HORRIABLE pain that almost throws me down.
 Have days where confusion comes back also.
 Also my last colonscopy turned up 5 precancerous polyups.
 Before statin drugs, I never had a one of them, 5 year.
 This medicine is posion!
 We do not know if the damage it does to us is permenant or not.
 I feel like I have been cheated out of growing old naturally and will question every ailmant I have from now on as natural or statin induced.
 In my whole life, I didn't see a doctor as much as I have since I started Lipitor drugs and since I have been off of it.
 The doctor always brushed off my complaints or would write me a RX for another dangerous drug!
 WHEN are doctors going to listen to the people are paying him to treat them and quit believing those who PROFIT from the sale of their drugs they push on unsuspecting people.
 (What happened to DO NO HARM? ).
 They have killed my faith in drugs, doctors and the FDA.
 DOCTORS!
 WAKE UP!!
 THEY ARE MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE FOOLS AND IDIOTS that can be bought for a free lunch or a plate of cookies!
 I also say, get those darn drug ads OFF of TV!."
"loss of muscle, weakness, liver disfunction, exhaustion."
"extreme muscle pain.
 avoid this drug.
 do your research."
"muscle pain/inability to walk with left foot pain.
 Memory loss.
 overall loss of muscle tone.
 Unable to control weight.
 Try to get a cardiologist to listen to you regarding symptoms.
 Called Pfizer and talked with nurse there and she recommended I let my doctor know about symptoms.
 She explained that drug was mfg in USA.
 My concern was that maybe some of the drug was mfg outside of USA, like maybe China and that a portion of the formula was causing problems.
 But in general the whole formula is poison so far as I am concerned.
 Thank God for this website.
 Am seeing new GP this week, and if he doesn't take me off Lipitor, am going to do it myself.
 Will take my chances rather than live this hell any longer.
 Have been on Lipitor for 6 years too long."
"mostly i suffer restless leg syndrom 30 min. into taking it.
 otherwise, first dose i felt better.
 be careful if you're on lipitor and your doctor begins to try and put you on medications for high triglycerides.
 i was put on tricor and it was extraordinarily horrible.
 side effects you can't believe.
 we summerized it as a conflict between the lipitor and tricor.
 if you must take another med for triglycerides and you begin to feel flu like, cramps in chest, legs, rashes appear, sleep very heavily, sleep alot or feel fatigued consider keeping tabs and if the side effects don't improve or there's more added in 2 weeks time, discontinue doseage.
 side effects may increase IE: gums swelling, visual anomalies, numbness in muscles, sore throat, soreness in mucous membrane areas."
"I had flu-like symptoms and my legs just ached.
 They hurt from my ankles to my hips and on certain days I could hardly walk.
 The sad part is that I am only 47 years old."
"SUDDENLY one morning as I arose from a chair I received a sudden severe pain close to my the crotch area.
 Could barely move.
 Then the other side became painful.
 I crawled up and down stairs and could barely walk;had to use a cane.
 AND I had been healthy and active prior to Lipitor.
 Enlarged liver was the result of a blood test.
 Was taken off Lipitor, immediately, pain lessened, but muscles had become weak and stressed.
 Given 18 sessions of physical therapy, before body returned to comfortable gait.
 Pain free ever since.
 Cannot take any statins ever again.
 Was put on Zetia, taken off recently,1 1/2 year later."
"Terrible charlie horses, cramping, my neck glands hurt.
 My mother was began to have symptoms of als shortly after her lipitor dose was increased.
 She wasn't formally diagnosed for a year and a half after that.
 I lost my mother on January 12, 2008.
 I want to know if lipitor is connected to als.
 My husband was on it for less than 6 months and he noticed leg pains, neck glands hurt, trouble swallowing and more."
"Joint pain, SEVERE muscle pain - especially in lower calfs of both legs.
 Some mornings I had a hard time walking.
 Didn't lower cholesterol much.
 Be Very Very Careful using this drug and other statins.
 This bad stuff sneaks up on you and - BAM - you could be in BIG trouble!
 Was on this and then Zocor for a total of 3 months.
 When I thought I was having a heart attack they admitted me to emergency room and overnight stay.
 No real heart problems - but weak heart muscle - likely cause of Lipitor.
 Lower legs have been hurting for over one year since I stopped taking meds.
 Doctors just conducted biopsy of leg muscle because it is inflamed and waiting for results.
 Likely not good.
 Also much fatigue then - and now.
 DO NOT TAKE STATINS - and if you do I hear the CQ10 is a good protector for some of the muscle damage that the statins can cause.
 Too late for me, I think, as the damage is done and permanent."
"I started to take 20 mg lipitor in August 2006, after 6 months, I reduced to take 10 mg, and after another 6 months, I reduced the lipitor intake to 5 mg.
 During all these 18 months, my LDL and cholesterol in 70s and 120s and I did not feel much side effects.
 When I incresed lipitor from 5 mg to 10 mg about 3 months ago, I started to experience the following side-effects started at different time: loss body balance, joint pain, muscle aches, weak legs, and some memory loss.
 About 2 months ago while I first told my doctor I lost some body balance and it might be due to lipitor buy my doctor told me the side effect was most likely by some other reason(s).
 During my second visiting him, he told me my blood test CK is 90 and my muscle should be OK.
 Then I continued to take 10 mg lipitor, but I felt more on muscle and joint pain and I started to feel I lost some memory.
 Therefore, I deeply believed that I had side effects by taking lipitor.
 After about a week to 10 day without lipitor, I got my memory back to nomal level and my body balance is getting better.
 During my third doctor visit, my doctor finally believed that I got bad side effects and he told me it would take months for recovery.
 Now my doctor wants me to take B3 or Niaspan instead of lipitor."
Caused extreme pain in back an legs.
"I only took Lipitor a short time then was switched to Zocor.
 Leg cramps, fatique, overall weak feeling.
 I quit taking the Statin drug 2 years ago.
 I went to American Heart lung ass. website and put in my 10 year risk factor.
 By dropping my total cholesterol from 259 down to 200 only reduced my risk factor by 1%.
 I showed this and other info to my Doctor and she understood and said it was my choice.
 I feel normal today and will never take these drugs again.
 Here is site to check your risk factor. http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/problem.html
 Also I found out you should report side effects to FDA at. http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/problem.html
 They estimate only 20% to 30% of drug side effects get reported.
 I encourage everyone to report their experiences with these drugs.
 (We have to the Doctors don't).
 These Statins are dangerous over perscribed drugs."
"depression, finger stiffness, finger joints locking up, much worse in the mornings.
 After being off lipitor for 3 weeks, my depression is gone, but the locking fingers and finger stiffness and pain is no better."
"muscle weakness, tendon weakness and ruptures, memory loss.
 I started taking Lipitor 3/29/06 to control elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.
 I started taking 10 mg per day along with omega 3, fish oil, change in diet and exercise and reduced total, LDL and Tri's to acceptable levels within 3 mos.
 However, I tore my right Achilles tendon on 2/4/07 by just simply taking off from a sprinters stance.
 I then tore my left Achilles tendon on 10/26/08 by simply jumping in the air after my son won his playoff football game.
 Someone at the Dr's office recently recommended to me to do a search for possible connection between statin use and tendon damage/ruptures.
 Much to my surprise there is a significant amount of study and history of this connection.
 (Google statins tendon )
 I have stopped the use of Lipitor immediately after finding out about this connection.
 I have always been very active, athletic and have worked out pretty consistently since my High School years.
 I am 41 now and cannot understand why now I am having th."
"Abdominal distention - feel full.
 Gained about 5 lbs the first week.
 back pain in the am, leg cramps on and off.
 Weird tight feeling in my head.
 Gas, insomnia, loss of muscle strength.
 I have Sores on the inner cheeks.
 Weird tight feeling in chest cavity at times, when exercising.
 I was in otherwise good health before starting, although it's only been a week.
 It should be noted that this is my third time trying this med.
 I am not drinking the koolaid on this miracle drug.
 I think it has major side effects that the mfgs are still not attributing to the drug.
 There is a lot of good reads out there, including articles in the NY times - do some research - it seems a lot of us are on the fence.
 I'm in a very high risk category, with levels over 300, a horrible ratio, and tryc through the roof."
"flatulence, mild aches, occasional indigestion.
 Overall this seems to be working reasonably well -- brought my triglycerides and LDL down to normal levels but not sure if it's really from the Lipitor or from major life-style changes and bringing my blood sugar down.
 In any event, I haven't had any serious problems with this drug aside from having to be a bit more careful in the gym and being the butt of fart jokes."
"taken since 2004, just got off this stuff a month or so now, had memory loss, extreme ache in left arm and sometimes left leg.
 thought it was another issue, spent the last 4 years with neurologists doing MRI, nerve tests, every test known to detect the reason for this.
 nothing found.
 decided to stop taking lipitor and am much improved.
 can do many things without my arm aching now.
 this ache was extreme, almost unbearable, many doctors just ignore the side effects of this drug."
"Severe lower back pain and an aching pain across my shoulders.
 Generally I also felt weak.
 The symptoms first started after about 4 months of taking this drug and tapered down for a couple of weeks after stopping.
 I tried 3 different statins, all with the same horrid side effects.
 I will NEVER take another statin drug."
"shrinking muscels,leg arms,neck vertgo from convusing neck muscels.
 unable to get out of bed,loss of strength,memory,halucinations been of it for 2 years,not quite cured kill."
"I HAVE LITTLE CIRCULATION IN MY FINGERS.
 NEW RESEARCH SHOWS THAT 40 MG. OF LIPITOR IMPROVES CIRCULATION IN A GOOD AMOUNT OF PATIENTS.
 MY DOCTOR CHECKED MY LIVER ENZYMES BEFORE I STARTED.
 THEY WERE NORMAL UPON TAKING THE LIPITOR, MY FINGERS STARTED TO FEEL BETTER ON THE 4TH DAY AND THE ULCERATIONS I EXPERIENCE STARTED HEALING.
 I WAS SO HAPPY AND SO WAS MY DOCTOR.
 HE SAID TO REPEAT MY LAB WORK IN 6 WEEKS.
 WELL I JUST FOUND OUT THAT MY LIVER COUNTS ARE TOTALLY WHACY AND I HAVE TO STOP THE DRUG.
 I AM GLAD THAT MY DOCTOR IS RIGHT ON TOP OF IT, BUT IT IS SO DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE IT WAS HELPING.
 I DID HAVE EXTREME EXHAUSTION BUT THEY SUGGESTED FOR ME TO TAKE IT IN THE MORNING INSTEAD OF NIGHT AND THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE.
 AFTER MY LABS ARE DONE AGAIN IN 3 WEEKS, THEY MIGHT TRY ANOTHER STATIN DRUG.
 AFTER READING THI WEBSITE, I DON'T HAVE MUCH HOPE.
 IT HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL THOUGH.
 IT CAN BE A GREAT DRUG FOR MOST, JUST NOT ALL."
"Cannot take more than 10mg because I feel drugged on any stronger dose.
 The 10mg brings my level to the cutoff point.
 Have no side effects at all."
"severe muscle pain.
 could not lie on either side in bed.
 each day it got worse and my shoulder pain was unbearable.
 Because of Lipitor I had very serious depression and thoughts of hurting myself.
 I figured out myself to stop taking Lipitor as my doctor never connected the drug with the side effects I always told him about."
"rhabdomyolosis w/cpk of 14,600 in aug./2006.
 2 biopsies confirmed statin damage at mayo/rochester,mn.
 even then only 3of5 drs. would admit statin damage.
 now live w/myalgia,periphael neuropathy,tinninitus and rheumatoid arthritis.
 unbelievable amount of people come to talk about their aches and pains since going on statin drugs,how can the medical community continue to deceive at such a level-{truly shameful}."
"Muscle pain (severe neck, shoulder, back pain. leg pain) has become increasingly pronounced in the past few months (have taken Lipitor for 3+ years).
 Dr suggests side effects may be due to cumulative effect - will cease taking for approx 2 weeks to determine if there is any improvement."
"Hip, leg,shoulder pain.
 Developed limp on left side.
 Stiffness in morning and after sitting.
 Extreme fatigue.
 Depression.
 Difficulty sleeping.
 I was told there were no side effects when first put on statins and did not suspect my ailments were related.
 Upon discontinuing Lipitor, I began to improve almost immediately--less pain and stiffness, more energy and improved sleep quality.
 This is a life altering drug that should be carefully and objectively evaluated.
 I would not recommend it to anyone."
"Ringing in the ears, memory loss."
"muscle pain, stiffness/pain in hands that kept me awake at night and limited my ability to perform routine tasks such as type, trouble with walking/balance neck, and shoulder pain.
 .
 They should rename this disability in a bottle ! ."
cramping in calf at night bad enough to wake from deep sleep screaming.
"Started with muscle pain and weakness, which I thought was due to my age and job.
 When my doctor got around to checking my liver enzymes, they were sky-high.
 My doctor said to stop taking Lipitor immediately.
 When the pain and fatigue continued, the doctor seemed surprised.
 The problems continued, and a specialist did a muscle biopsy.
 It showed permanent, irreversible muscle damage.
 The good news - the muscle damage shouldn't get any worse."
"cramps in left leg, no feeling in right leg."
"been taking Lipitor for 15 years ,have experienced all manner of side effects from irregullar heartbeat ,sever fatigue and now have a fatty liver !!!!
 yet doctors insist i still take it ,40mg daily .
 I also has type 1 Diabetes for 35 years.
 Lipitor does its job but at what cost latter down the line !!!!!."
"Had 1 pill only 10mg lipitor(had tried lipex(2pills)1st but face had swollen up-cleared 2weeks) anyway the next morning -after sitting down for 10minutes- i stood up to walk and it was a very painful and a very slow stooped debilatating (compressed back)type of walk but after 5-10 minutes of standing could straighten back-only problem when sitting down -lower back.
 no other part of back a problem-can play tennis with only slight pain if bending over.
 it is now 14 days and still same problem -tend to stand or lie down for computor work no other side affects that im aware of .
 Will see doctor if it continues to be a problem in 1 week though i see some have continued to have problems even after stopping and after reading this blog i am swayed to think that it is a degenative muscle problem( which will heal in time due to 1 pill only usage) and may not be other internal organ reactions as i 1st suspected.

"Loss of memory, aphasia, tremor, violent anger, tearfulness, insomnia, muscle weakness, easy bruising, and nosebleeds.
 Bleeding & bruising problems stopped in about one month after stopping the drug.
 Insomnia is better but not gone.
 Mood problems, language problems, and memory problems lessened by still present.
 Tremor is apparently here to stay since it's been about two year since stopped the drug and the tremor is the same.
 Doctor denies any connection between the effects and the drug, and also denies any connection between stopping the drug and having improvement/cessation of symtoms.
 I also watched my mother-on-law and her brother both start and stop the drug due to extreme fatigue and muscle pain.
 It is the WORST DRUG EVER MADE, and the cost of it both in terms of money and emotional and physical pain does not justify the handful of heart attackes it *might* prevent.
 Do yourself a favor - buy some fish oil and some flush-free niacin to treat your cholesterol, and run like hell away from Lipitor!!!."
"muscle pain and weakness, headaches, sleep disturbances.
 Have been on this drug for about 3 years but for the last 18 months I've been having problems with various muscles.
 Started with my SI joints.
 lots of pain in the muscles there, very tight.
 Then my neck started getting stiff and the muscles are like boards they're so tight.
 Now the pain has gone into my shoulder and upper arm on my left side.
 Just last week I noticed my right arm is tight also.
 I can't sleep on either shoulder now.
 My lower back is also tight again!
 And I get terrible headaches from the tight neck muscles.
 I googled muscle pain and Lipitor showed up on the first 6 or 7 entries!!
 I read all the comments on this page and couldn't believe it!!
 I see my symptoms over and over!
 So, I had blood tests done this week and have elevated creatine so was told today to stop Lipitor immediately, and will see my doctor next week.
 After reading all these comments, I have no doubt that Lipitor is the cause of all this discomfort.
 I just hope and pray that I can recover from these terrible side effects.
 I will use vitamin C and other natural things to help my cholesterol.
 but if that doesn't help.
 hey.
 I'd rather die from a heart attack than die a slow painful death on Lipitor.
 I think drugs are released on the market these days without enough long-term clinical studies to make sure they are safe."
"Kidney failure, difficulty swallowing, persistent pain in calf and knee, short term memory loss, peripheral neuropathy, constipation, sleep disturbance, mood change, rage.
 I took 80mg of Lipitor for 8 years.
 My symptoms got so bad that I had to stop working.
 Recently I was diagnosed with kidney failure and also put on zetia.
 I immediately started to feel even worse, but took the drug for a year until my symptoms got to be unbearable.
 My doctor dismissed the leg pain and said that kidney failure was unrelated.
 Do not take statins!
 They will rob you of your mind and ruin your health.
 The medical community will try to convince you that you'll live longer and avoid heart attacks by taking this.
 Read the facts.
 I stopped all statins and am starting to see improvement in swallowing.
 Leg pain is gone.
 My memory is getting better.
 I'll never recover from the kidney failure, will need dialysis or transplant.
 Will explore alternative natural remedies."
"Very slowly, over many years, I've developed debilitating muscle pains, horrible fatigue, tingling in my arms, legs and fingers; I've gone to the doctor for 5 years, at least, trying to find out what is wrong with me.
 I JUST turned 40 years old and should not feel like this.
 Out of nowhere, I heard about CoQ10 depletion and just started the supplement today.
 I was never told ANY of these symptoms could relate to the Lipitor - in fact, I specifically asked if any of my medications could be causing these problems."
"leg cramps at 40mg.
 went away at 20mg.
 ldl stayed lower.
 just reduce your dosage to retain benifits and stop side effects."
"muscle cramps all over, depression and irritable, tired.
 Statins may or may not help with circulatory problems, but they definitely cause other severe problems.
 I will not take any statins again."
"Stabbing pain between shoulder blades, I am 52 and feel 82, no energy, muscle tone depletion, strength depletion, numbness in upper legs from knee to thigh, pain and numbness in left foot, left foot larger than right now by one size, pain in feet, need special shoes just to walk now, I feel like I will not be alive next year.
 I've been on this for 5 years, and am going to quit after finding this website.
 Doctors did nothing for me.
 They have no idea what this drug does to people!
 Time to exercise, eat healthy food, and get OFF this stuff.
 Thank you everyone for taking the time to post, and helping me understand what was happening.
 Hate this stuff.
 Crestor just as bad."
"Took this drug for about 6 months.
 Did the trick on lowering what is was supposed to, but I suffered extreme depression.
 Not worth the suicidal thoughts, so I quit taking it."
"Severe plantar faciitis; debillitating leg pain; severe leg muscle weakness; hand weakness (constantly dropping things); palpitations; tachycardia; irrecular heartbeat; throat tightness; difficulty/shallow breathing; fatigue.
 Began on 20 mg, ended on 40 mg.
 Taking Lipitor might very well be the biggest mistake of my life."
"My elder brother, who has expired 15 days back in the age of 54 years, was put on the same medicine for blood pressure in the age of 45 years which definitely resulted into causing him ALS in the last three years before his tragic death without any cure.
 He developed the symptoms like stiffness in whole body, loss of balance, no power to standup himself, loss of weight, acute weakness in the muscles of whole body and their dilution in size, constipitation, no control over urination and in the last 20 days before the death, he suffered with loss of vocal sound, choking the throat, looseness in the body structure, complete stopage of easing out and lungs detoriation like less intake of oxigen leading to his painful death in the last time.
 I strongly feel the lipitor had the crucial side effect upon my brother causing him to suffer with ALS for which there is reportedly no cure in Allopathy , while therefore i put my brother on Homeopathitic treatment which at least avoided the bad effect.
 Please avoid the allopathic treatment and follow the Yoga-sustem or regular phyical exercise to prevent the diseases."
"Swollen , burning feet and ankles.
 The ball of the foot would feel as if it was inflamed.
 Constant pins and needles in the ball of the foot and the toes and occasionally would get very painful pins and needles over entire foot.
 Had to remove socks and elevate legs to get relief from swelling.
 Quit taking Lipitor and within three days swelling stopped, foot and ankle skin flaked off like dermatitis and slowly over the next 4 weeks the symptoms reduced except for an occasional flareup.
 Still have minor problems after 4 weeks but it is 80% back to normal."
"Trouble walking, hard to pick up feet and balance is off at times.
 Pain in muscles of both upper arms.
 Arms feel HEAVY and hands are tingling and somewhat numb.
 Have trouble holding on to things.
 I have been off Lipitor 1 year and 2 months.
 Have been to several specialists.
 I feel Lipitor has taken away my life."
"Weak muscles.
 Achey like when you have a very high fever, only without the fever.
 Elevated white blood cell count (very high), but liver emzymes were normal.
 I was on lowest dose.
 My LDL started at 90, but MD insisted that because I am diabetic, I should be on lipitor and try to get below 70.
 Lipitor knocked it down to 25.
 I do not know if the problems were due to Lipitor, or having LDL down to 25.
 I asked MD he stated They (whomever they are), have not established a low threshold for what is safe .
 I stated that just because it has not been proven in a lab, does not mean it is not true.
 I went off the meds, and am now in search of a new MD, as I have felt worse under this DR care than ever before in my life."
tremors and tingles although the body.
"Deep depression, insomnia, joint stiffness in hands and feet, inability to think clearly to the point I thought I would have to quit my job.
 This drug dramatically lowered my cholesterol but ruined my quality of life.
 After repeated visits to my doctor complaining of these debilitating symptoms he finally made the connection and took me off.
 Within 3 days, I started to feel like myself again.
 Cholesterol plays an important role in brain and nerve function and is essential to our good overall health.
 Do your research.
 Stripping your body of it can be devastating.
 I would much rather take my chances with a slightly elevated level than go through that again.
 Horrible.
 Pfizer should be ashamed of themselves for not clearly stating the possibility of these side effects."
"tired-weak-pains all over body-groggy-light headed.
 all these statin drugs are death in a bottle.
 they are the perfect med as they will cause the poor dumb patient to spend huge sums of money on tests-pain killers and other statins till they will one day they will just give up and lay down and die-BROKE-what a well laid plan by big pharma and covered by the criminal FDA food and drug syndicate."
"I took Lipitor for 6 weeks and noticed extreme dehydration and extremely dry eyes.
 My eyes are so dry that they stick to the eyelids at night and I am getting microabrasions on them - very painful.
 Additionally, despite eating a pure fiber diet to lower my cholesterol, the medicine has made me extremely constipated.
 I have been off now for 5 days.
 The constipation is starting to go away as are the dry eyes although they are still quite painful.
 I have started the Blood Type Diet for my blood type (A) and will lower my cholesterol naturally since I cannot fathom being on Lipitor after my experience with it.
 I would not recommend this medicine to anyone."
"I have had unexplained fatigue (sleeping 11-12 hours a night, and still having no energy all day)since starting Lipitor 2 years ago; my new doctor did a new test and said my SED rate is high- he suspects it is the Lipitor and told me to go off it immediately.
 I don't know if this is the problem, but after reading this site I will not take a statin drug again.
 I also have short term memory loss, and an unexplained cough.
 Sure, it lowers cholesterol, but I am a zombie."
"Aches and pain from head to toe, very grouchy.
 I have been competitive in road racing for almost 20 years, but after starting this drug I began to notice my performance falling off.
 Later I got pains so bad that I could not run.
 I stopped taking this drug and after about 3 months am almost back where I was with my running.
 I detest lawyers, but statin class drugs are crying out for a class action lawsuit to stop their use."
"Toe tinglingling, numbness in toes, feel like I am in a fog most of the day, memory impaired, hair loss ( major symptom for me), low grade headache, vision impaired, calf pain.
 

 Lipitor does help reduce total serum cholesterol considerably in many patients but the side effects of this 'poisonous' medication are extremely alarming.
 I fail to comprehend why this medication is still permitted to be on the market as there is evidence that those who have been on long term have suffered irreversible muscle damage plus other permanent side effects.
 How come no one has sued the manufacturers as yet?
 Do patients have to die first before a pharmaceutical entity can be sued?
 Surely some of the people who have written in to this site should get together and institute litigation?."
"painfull stiff joints pins and needles on right arm.
 hadnt realised it could be due to lipitor untill I read this sight.
 my doctor has just sent of blood test to see whats wrong, be interasting to see what comes back."
"Daily headaches.
 I also started on hormones and thought that might be causing them but as I'm reading this I'm thinking it's the Lipitor.
 I haven't been on it long enough to know if it reduces my cholesterol but even if it does I don't know if I'll continue to take it if the headaches don't go away."
"Doc put me on 10 mg/day.
 Some stomach discomfort initially, but I seemed to get over that after the first few weeks.
 Some muscle aches and pains which I didn't have before now seem to come and go.
 Wife says that I am a lot grouchier since I started taking it.
 And just yesterday, was out doing the yard spring clean-up, and noticed extreme fatigue and shortness of breath.
 Very worrisome.
 I have stopped taking Lipitor, and will check back with my doctor asap.
 I just recently had my 3 month cholesterol check-up, and the doctor was very pleased since my overall cholesterol count dropped to 3.7 from over 7.
 I also take Atacand for high blood pressure - have been on that one for years.
 He doesn't know yet about the fatigue and shortness of breath attacks, because that just happened."
"memory loss, transient amnesia, severe shoulder and knee pain, insomnia, extreme tiredness,hard to get up in the AM and hard to stay awake, crippling back pain, depression, loss of balance.
 I took Pravachol and Zocor before Lipitor - cardiologist increased dose of Lipitor to 40mg and 80mg.
 The last 4 years of my life have been a physical and mental nightmare.
 As soon as stopped Lipitor immediately felt much better but degenerative back disease (MD said was due to aging) is still severe but improving somewhat.
 Statins destroyed my life, I am certain of."
"Blury vision.
 bad balance."
"Prescribed it for High Cholesterol (just under 6)
 Within 2 weeks had sore feet (Faciitis) and continued to get worse.
 Hands, fingers, wrists, lumbar and AC joints, dry mouth, hair falling out.
 Dr diagnosed it as autoimmune polyarthritis and wanted me to start anti-inflammatories for the pain.
 Took one and couldn't stand the side effects so stopped immediately.
 After researching at night because I couldn't sleep, thought maybe the Lipitor might be the problem.
 Stopped taking it immediately (3 days ago) and already I can move my feet and ankles.
 Not hobbling around and can get out of bed without assistance.
 Hands still sore but have some movement back in my fingers.
 Hoping this will continue to improve given more time off the drug.
 This drug is poisionous.
 I haven't felt well since I started taking Lipitor.
 The fatigue was as bad as the pain in my joints, if not worse.
 Today is the first day I haven't needed to rest during the day and I am hoping this will improve as time passes.
 What the hell is in this god forsaken drug?!."
"I took this drug for 2 years before onset of joint pain (knees)and painfull welts on bottom of feet (had to use cane to walk).
 Initially, my quack MD put me on anti-inflam. drugs.
 Subsequently, I quit the drug and the MD.
 All symptoms subsided completely.
 However, I had a milder reaction to Zocor; dizziness with Pravachol; now on Zetia (mild joint pain).
 I believe that Lipitor left me with permanent joint damage and would join any class-action lawsuit relating to this crumby drug Lipitor."
"When I began taking Lipitor I had what the doctors referred to as TIA's.
 Loss of balance, loss of speech and after several months I began having seizure type symptoms.
 I have been seeing a Neurologist since I was told I was having TIA's.
 I have gone through a TEE and a brain catheter and everything came back normal.
 The Neurologist told me to stop taking Liptor one week ago and I am starting to feel a little better.
 I am still feeling extremely tired.
 I am hoping this all passes."
"I was on 5mg - cut a 10mg pill in half.
 After about 2 weeks taking it I woke up with leg cramps.
 During the day if I squatted (e.g. in the garden) or tried to get on a ladder I got foot/leg cramps.
 I mentioned it to my doctor who said it couldn't possibly be related to the Lipitor .
 It kept getting worse and worse - legs began feeling very tired, couldn't go up stairs easily, had cramping events in my legs 3-4 times a day.
 I took 5mg/day of Lipitor for a year but finally quit as my legs were hurting too much.
 Most cramping stopped within a couple of days but there was a long tail - it has only been in the last two years that all cramping stopped (having been off since 2005).
 It did help get my TC down to 180 from 220, and my HDL to 70-90 frum 30.
 My legs are still very weak even now - but they don't cramp.
 My physician said it was all in my head."
"neck pain/back spasms/foggy thinking/insomnia.
 I took this drug for 1.5 years.
 Great results.
 but the side effects were very negative as listed above.
 My dr. reviewed my complaints and agreed that it wasn't worth it.
 I am going to do a diet and excercise change.
 60 days blood check and then look at natural options/red rice/increase omega 3/ect.
 No more statins for me.
 I don't have plaque so I have options.
 My husband has a high plaque count so he doesn't."
"I just had a blood test done as part of a routine physical.
 Some values indicate liver disease.
 Wondering if it is from Lipitor.
 Has anyone else out there developed liver damage from Lipitor.
 Please e-mail me.
 Lipitor seems to work, but I am very concerned about the side effects now.
 I have been taking Lipitor probably over 5 years.
 Also have experienced leg cramps, mental confusion, but thought it was just the aging process."
Memory Loss.
"sore muscles, memory loss, insomnia.
 seems to work on cholesterol but there should be a better way."
"Joint pain in the knees and hips.
 Pain in the shoulders.
 A tingling sensation in the back of my neck.
 Tinnitus.
 Weak muscles.
 Lipitor did lower my cholesterol, and I had no side effects for 2.5 years.
 Now my legs , shoulders, and hips ache.
 The most acute pain is in the legs.
 Stiffness is more prevalent in he morning.
 Getting out of bed is painful.
 The nurse practitioner did admit that these side effects can occur after 2 to 3 years.
 She suggested that I stop taking it for a few weeks.
 I stopped 2 months ago, and will not take it again.
 The tingling in the neck has stopped, but the leg and shoulder pain has not abated.
 I am 70 years old, weigh 167 lbs, exercise daily, don't smoke, and eat fruits and vegetables.
 I drink wine in moderation, haven't drank coffee or tea in over 20 years, but I do eat red meat in moderation.
 I will take my chances with elevated levels of high cholesterol, and only hope that the muscle damage is not permanent."
"leg pains,balance off,back pain (Lower and upper) finger pins and needles,brain vague.
 stomach pain, palpitations and feeling desperately miserable.
 off medication after 15 yrs of suffering.
 I feel a lot better but still have leg and back pain .
 I did this myself after consulting the doctor and taking him a print out of a web site with all symptoms listed.
 he tore it up .
 I will look for a new doctor and hope I am doing the right thing.
 don't take this its poison.
 Take raw oat meal sprinkled on your meal."
"Pain in shoulders joints to the point it was impossible to reach for anything above my shoulders.
 Quit taking it and was back to normal in two months.
 My doctor said it was arthritis or bursitus due to my age.
 He still would rather I be a cripple and go back on Lipitor."
"Taking 10 mg. and experiencing pain in feet and legs, including terrible leg cramps.
 Also have difficulty sleeping, occasional headaches and fatigue.
 Sex drive has decreased too.
 Wondering if the benefits are worth putting up with all of this.
 Cholesterol dropped from 225 to 145, but will ask doctor for an alternative."
"Severe pain in my calf muscles in my legs started about 7 months after taking the drug.
 My doctor kept me on it and insisted this was a common side effect.
 I complained for several months and then he switched me to another drug (Crestor) and the problems persisted.
 He then switched me to (Zochor).
 Finally I informed my doctor the pain was too severe and I was stopping as I found I could not even walk in the morning!
 The cramps persisted for months and then I tore a tendon in my ankle and months later my knee.
 I have had surgery but to no avail.
 I still have some form of pain daily.
 Before Lipitor I was in excellent shape and exercised regularly with no issues at all.
 I have never been the same.
 By the way 10Mg of Lipitor lowered my cholesterol 100 points but it was not worth it.
 This drug ruined my life!.
 Stop taking at first sign of muscle pain!."
"pain!!!!!
 I felt like I had sever arthritic condition.
 even tried two times per week with same results.
 tried other statins with same side effect .
 presently on crestor one time per week with occasional side effect of mild pain.
 MD said one time a week can be very effective for patients that have reaction to statins.
 Have not had bloodwork as yet to see if helped."
"None for three years, then bam!
 Toes became so painful I couldn't stand it, as did leg neuropathy.
 Lipitor made my cholesterol numbers improve greatly for three years.
 But alas, the side effects finally showed up with a vengeance, and I can no longer take Lipitor."
"I am the advocate for my father who took this drug for 8 months before he passed from an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2005.
 The patient data is reported for him by me.
 Briefly, my research during my advocacy efforts during his illness indicated that this drug may have contributed to the onset of his particular form of brain cancer (glial cell related cancer).
 That cancer was diagnosed 6 months after his initial Rx for Lipitor -- he died 2 months after his initial cancer diagnosis.
 There were no warning signs, deterioration was very fast and debilitating -- he was a model totally healthy individual by conventional medical standards.
 My father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old, had great cholesterol numbers, but he was a cardiac patient.
 He and the cardiologist agreed to go to Lipitor to see if they could drive LDL below 100 (his lipid profile was very, very good by usual medical standards).
 I will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen (my research showed that Lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what I know of my father's work history experience), but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this.
 My father could not speak for himself as his form of brain cancer was so aggressive that he went from a totally normal guy walking with a cane from initial neurological damage at inital dx for brain cancer to bedridden, unable to speak, feed himself, do anything for himself in 10 days.
 Don't know if this will really help anybody -- but just please be cautious with Rx medicines and advocate for yourself; you may not know everthing, but you do know best about what you are experiencing with these Rxs.
 keep doing your research, tell your doctor anything you find relevent about your life as it relates to Rxs you are given, and advocate hard for your quality of life."
"Leg pains, loss of memory, E.D. and sleep loss.
 I was never told of these possible side effects."
"leg pain, loss of memory, loss of libido and lack of sleep."
"Extreme tiredness, dizziness, memory loss, moody."
"muscle pain in back; insomnia.
 muscles on the sides of my back were constantly painful; I could not sleep even with ambien and melatonin.
 I only took it 9 days and it took a week for symptoms to gradually disappear."
"Muscle/joint pains, gastric upsets, insomnia, memory loss, anxiety, frozen shoulder .
 to name but a few.
 The medical profession should be made to advise patients more about the side-effects.
 Spotting them early can mean the difference between swift resolution or a lifetime of misery."
"Was put on lipitor 3 months ago because of high cholesteral.
 Took for a month and seemed to have problems with feet, etc but kept taking.
 I had tests done after a month.
 My doctor sent a letter and said to cut the dose in half for a month and have tests again.
 After my second set of tests she called me and told me to go off completely.
 She said she realized that my cholesteral would go back up, but CPK is of concern.
 Was raised to mid 200's.
 After a month I went in and of course my cholesteral was back up and my CPK level was elevated to over 500.
 Now am having another blood test a week later.
 Not sure what it will show but I feel horrible.
 Tingly hands, terrible musche aches.
 She told me no excercise until we determine what the problem is with CPK level.
 My husband said my face looks puffy.
 My eyes hurt all the time.
 I look sickly.
 This is horrible.
 Never again!
 DON'T TAKE THIS!!!!!!!."
"Swollen and stiff knees and elbows, mental distress, others that I am now only becoming aware of after reading many of these others testimonials.
 After being on Lipitor for 2 years my knees and elbows were getting increasingly stiff and sore.
 I'm a painter by trade and largely attributed it to over use of my joints.
 Repetitive stress syndrome.
 I went to my doctor, he sent me to an arthritis specialist, I had x-rays.
 nothing was found.
 I felt like an old (older) man during this period, I thought I was finished in terms of my trade and the things I enjoy most, like hiking.
 My prescription of lipitor ran out a few months after these tests were done.
 I didn't bother refilling it right away and noticed my knees and elbows felt better.
 I renewed the prescription and no sooner had I started taking it again that I felt the stiff joints return.
 So I stopped taking it, the stiffness goes away, started again, stiffness returns.
 After telling my doctor this story, right away he says oh yeah, that's probably right Pardon!?
 So why didn't you mention that possibility before all the tests?
 (luckily since I live in Canada, these tests were all covered by our health care system) I didn't make the connection to lipitor earlier because stiff, swollen joints were not listed as one of the side effects.
 Sore muscles yes, stiff swollen joints, no.
 I can see the class action suits coming against Pfizer."
"pain in my legs,loss of sense of smell,increase appetite,headaches,extreme fatigued,tingling in my arms and legs."
"Dizziness,falls,poor memory,loss of fine motor skills,stiffness in legs, sore feet.
 I began having falls shortly after starting lipitor approx 5years ago.
 Had an EEG at that time with no abnormalities.
 Had another EEG 6months ago with Frontal Lobe abnormalities which I suspect is due to Lipitor.
 Started on 20mg and progressed to 80mg."
"headache, insomnia,sore hip(tightIT band), depression.
 had to stop taking it too many side affects, lowerd my cholesterol nicely but made me miserable with each passing month."
"Congestion, cough, elbows burning, right heel pain, loss of concentration.
 I initially couldn't tell I was taking it.
 About two years ago I started waking up with significant congestion with clear phlem.
 Chest xray was clear.
 My doctor suspected allergies.
 Having 2 pets that seemed reasonable.
 About a year ago my elbows would burn like fire at times when I rested my arms on a surface.
 This would come and go.
 I also began having trouble focusing while reading and would skip around.
 Two months ago my right heel became painful for no reason.
 The more I walked on it the worse it felt.
 I switched shoes with no change.
 It hurt enough that I began to worry I might end up on disability if it got much worse.
 I was recently out of state for two weeks and still had congestion in spite of being in a totally different environment.
 That was when I suspected the Lipitor and did some research on line and saw matches with all of my symptoms.
 I immediately stopped it and the next morning the congestion was 80% less.
 I saw my doctor who agreed I need to stop it.
 He explained that there are a lot of side affects and there is no way to predict who will get which ones or when they will develop.
 The blood tests give a false sense of security since the results (like mine) can be normal yet other serious issues can develop."
"sudden onset severe depression.
 It worked very well the first time it was prescribed and I lost 20 pounds using it with exercise and diet.
 When this medication was combined with a SSRI it failed to reduce my HDL cholesterol in a meaningful amount and it caused intense anxiety attacks and short periods of intense depression."
"muscle aches in legs.
 I tried 10mg a day for 6 days but developed muscle pain in legs.
 Doctor is now putting me on 10mg once a week to see if I can tolerate that dosage.
 Thanks to all you guys for a heads-up on what can happen with this drug as it is nice not to be blindsided by the medical community.
 Thanks again to everybody who posts here!!."
"Initially there were no side effects.
 It took the better part of two years for them to start appearing.
 During that time, my numbers were doing great!
 But then, very gradually, things began to change.
 Fatigue was the first symptom for me.
 It hit hard!
 I was retireing at 9PM when it used to be 11:30.
 Then the muscle and joint pain kicked in.
 I felt much older than I was.
 My family noticed the short term memory loss before I did.
 It was very embarrasing for me.
 The blisterey rash on my arms and legs had me concerned even more.
 What was wrong with me?
 Is this what old age(62) should normally bring?
 When my vision became blurry, I started my search.
 That was in June of 2007.
 By August 07, I was off Lipitor for good.
 My cardiologist tried various substitutes without luck until we got to Simivastatin which seemed to work without the side effects."
Severe foot pain.
"Severe leg pain and weakness, muscle cramps in legs, feet, arms, ribs, face.
 I went from being a normal, active 46 year old male doing my job and normal activities of life until taking Lipitor.
 I took 20mg. for approximately 1 year, then started noticing the muscle problems so I discontinued it.
 That was about a year ago and I am still having severe pain and weakness in my muscles, especially the legs.
 I can barely make it up one flight of stairs to get to my office at work.
 Have no social activities now, can't even stand to fish anymore.
 I regret the day I ever took a statin drug and will warn everyone I talk to about the devastating effects of these drugs."
"Short term memory affected, loss of concentration levels, Dizzy, hightened Anxiety Levels,generaly feeling unwell like walking in a daze (Zombie like) Weakness in Leg Muscles.
 All of these where a gradual onset over time making it harder to identify the course.
 Terrible Medication!
 Ruined me every day quality of life!
 I was not surprised that many People reported similar and worst effects.
 Stay off it and find some other means to controll your cholesterol if you can.
 Big Money spinner for Lipitor who m ake Billions from it each year and it is making People quite sick.
 Naturepath for my options."
"Brain fog and decreased cognitive skills.
 Does wonders for reducing LDL Cholestrol.
 Short term memory and brain fog were brutal.
 Since I also have anxiety issues, I was not sure if Lipitor caused side effects.
 Stopped liptor and improved diet and memory improved."
"muscle wasting in the shoulders and arms,nerve problems in shoulder , fatigue and very sensative to the cold.
 started on 10mg raised to 20.
 numbers are great with the bloods but symtoms gradually got worse.
 ive just stopped taking them,going to start high dose fish oil,coenzyme10,vit c and alpha lipoic acid and see what the next bloods say,please note other meds were taken at the same time as the lipitor- ramipril and metoptolol &acid reducers for gout,so anybodies guess?."
"dosage was increased from 10 to 20 mg and the tingling and numbness in my feet and shins escalated.
 I even went to a podiatrist because my toes ached and my feet hurt.
 I've tried simvastatin, provastatin, and lovastatin.
 Each time the side effects return.
 I can't even sleep at night because of the sensations of tingling in my legs and feet.
 No more statins for me.
 Does anyone else have the pain in their toes, feet and shins?."
"Aches and pains, breathing difficulties, panic attacks, stength and stamina destroyed, palpatations, strong tingling in one hand, some tinititis and occassional ear aches.
 Have mentioned symptoms as they appeared to my doctor only to be prescribed zorloft for depression and anxiety and noten for heart palpatations.
 This in turn has seriously upset my stomach which the doctor prescribed yet another drug for.
 40 mg dose Lipitor worked well in reducing my overall cholesterol levels; which are high in my family.
 The last 6 months of my life have been a health nightmare.
 I was a fit, strong and very active person 5 years ago.
 Now I am struggling walking too far and functioning in general.
 I have only been off lipitor for 2 weeks so time will tell if lipitor is to blame for my deteriorated health; winding down on the noten and zorloft as well.
 I am trying the VitC, CoQ10 and omega 3 path."
"unexplained cough.
 Doctors was unaware of this being a side effect of the drug.
 I stopped using it 3 days ago and the cough is gone.
 Last week, also stopped for two days and the cough stopped.
 Each time I go back to taking Lipitor, I begin to cough heavily."
"Pain in joints and muscles, including knees, ankles feet wrist shoulders and elbows.
 Unable to even climb 1 flight of stairs.
 Weight gain (due to no activity from pain?)
 Headaches, fatigue, confusion and memory loss.
 Uncontrollable gas and diarrhea as well as a burning in my stomach.
 Dr never mentioned stopping medication.
 Just physical therapy and pain medication."
impotence.
Muscule pain and numb leg chest pain.
"Shoulder, knee, elbow, joint pain.
 Memory fog.
 Anxiety.
 Low Libido.
 Atorvastatin generic.
 Experienced brain fog immediatley.
 Really bad for my highly technical attention to detail work.
 Started experiencing joint pain approx 6 months in.
 Left shoulder is so bad right now have ice pack as I am typing this and have been taking alleve daily for the inflamation and pain.
 I previously had pain in the other shoulder, elbow, and knee, but moved and had to get another MD.
 In the meantime I was off the drug for a few weeks and saw improvement of those areas.
 Now I have been back on for another 6 months and the left shoulder is terribly painful.
 I have stopped the med for a week and hope to see improvement soon.
 Diet and exercise does not work for my genetic high cholesterol, but I am with the majority here and it's not worth it if ending up crippled or senile.
 I will find a natural alternative.
 I wish you all the best."
"I only used it 3X but developed kidney pain each time and elevated BP.
 Within an hour of the last time I applied it, my heart rate jumped to 106 & my BP 145/95.
 I also experienced horrible anxiety.
 I thought I was going to have heart attack or stroke."
"I can hardly believe that a topically applied gel is causing this stuff, but it gets better when I quit using it and returns when I do use it.
 hard to breathe, lungs feel heavy, general feeling of sadness, tiredness, wanting to quit everything and give up (SOOOOOO not my personality).
 I was blaming my antibiotic for these side effects, but now I see that they come and go with the use of the solaraze.
 Scary.
 LEt me be the first to say that I have extremely porous skin, so I am probably absorbing a higher dose than was thought likely, I have eczema and take other meds that exfoliate my skin, so probably a whopping dose is going in.
 I have found that I can use a q-tip and just put it on a few spots and then do not get the global bad effect, so I may do it this way and just treat one arm at a time, then one leg."
"Heartburn and stomach upset.
 It seems to be working pretty well.
 I still have pain but less severe.
 I have been somewhat concerned about taking this drug for so long due to the possible side effects, but my Dr checks me out (blood work, etc )every four months and I seem to be doing allright.
 I don't want to get started on stronger, possibly habit forming drugs."
"I took one dose and 15 minutes later i felt dizzy and had chest pain and felt like my life was gonna slip away and die.
 i called my Dr and he is an idiot .
 he told me that this medicine does not cause these symptoms I hate when Pharmecitical company push these and have DR's advertise and experiment on us like animals they jsut make us sicker."
"Extreme upset stomach.
 couldn't eat or drink anything.
 It did take away all of my pain and I was able to sleep very well through the night.
 It's just too bad that it upset my stomach so much.
 I didn't have any other side effects than this one."
"dry mouth (also taking cymbalta).
 when i first took voltaren, i didn't feel it helped me at all.
 however when i stopped, i was in a great deal more pain the following day.
 when i restarted it, i started feeling better.
 so it doesn't get rid of my pain, but does seem to make it more bearable."
"No side effects at all in first 24 hours.
 First day.
 Immediate and absolute relief.
 I don't get immediate and lasting relief from panadeine or Ibuprofen plus.
 Codeine medications aren't as effective and upset my stomach on occasions.
 So far this voltaren rapid 25 hasn't.
 First time in years my back ache has gone away so effectively.
 Really hope it last and i can wake up still feeling completely pain free."
"I had no side effects the first two days.
 The doctor prescribed for me to take 2 per day and I'm very glad I didn't.
 I took one per day and this is the third day.
 My face has felt numb most of the day and I feel light headed.
 I've had to get up and walk this feeling off, which has not been fun on the knee.
 I wouldn't suggest voltaren because it did nothing for the inflammation in the knee and has me in a panic until I can get this stuff out of my system."
"Possibly diarrhea and stomach pain, but most likely none because I am taking this with a nasty antibiotic for a sinus infection that definitely causes diarrhea and nausea.
 I was supposed to take it 2x/day for 7 days and then 2x/day as needed.
 I completed the 7 days and then did not take it on the 8th day.
 The pain was immediately worse than before taking Voltaren.
 It does help the pain in my knee, which is a strained meniscus, but I'm afraid that the drug is masking the pain which enables me to overexert my joints and cause more injury.
 This really makes me nervous.
 I am going to speak with my doctor about this possibility."
"Horrific medication - Suffered an acute pancreatic attack with critical blood levels that almost caused my death.
 My entire body was ""shutting"" down.
 My blood reports were at critical levels, BP was very low 98/60, fever for over 6 weeks, weight loss of 10 lbs.,yellow color to my skin, couldn't walk straight,prostate infection, sweating, nausea, pain in stomach & back, urination effected, hoarseness/coughing, heart racing, disoriented.
 Then the doctor in charge left us floundering on our own, going from one specialist after another to counter what was happening.
 My children did some research on the web about my drugs that I was taking, which included Voltaren,and learned about the adverse reactions to this drug and I stopped Voltaren.
 The specialists agreed with this conclusion, since they were exact to my problems.
 My body reacted and I recovered gradually.
 My advice to all - STOP - Find something else.
 I lost 2 months of my life and I still don't remember the entire e.
 If you are taking this drug - Make absolutely sure that you get blood work done every 6 months, in order to catch any critical levels in your blood.
 Then - STOP - the drug."
"Mild sedation.
 This is a GREAT drug for me.
 I am usually VERY affected negatively with most meds.
 Voltaren totally relieves my pain when nothing else worked.
 I take it with a meal so I don't have any stomach problems with it.
 It mellows me out a little but not too much."
"This drug makes me so agitated--insomnia, hideously increased muscle tension, short tempered, impatient.
 It really helped with pain in hand & arm, but the agitation is unbearable.
 I got spasms in my back from it and had to get therapy for those.
 I know it doesn't make sense with the tiny dose I'm taking, & they say no systemic effects from the topical gel, but I've gone on & off it 4 or 5 times now and the effects when using it are unmistakeable."
"occasionally some leg cramps (in lower left leg only) if taken too late in the day.
 No side effects if taken before noon.
 This drug has helped tremendously with aches and discomfort from the arthritis.
 Totally cured the pain in my foot from tendonitis and plantar fasciitis."
"I had an allergic reaction to this medication.
 My skin has be itchy, sore throat/burning/itchy, and numbness in tongue and gums.
 Stop med and been taking Benadryl."
"Eye problem, noticed after 1 day my vision was not the same, seem to be harder to focus, After putting 2 an 2 together I stopped taken the Voltaren Rapid 50mg, It has been 5 days sens I stopped taken them and my left eye is getting bad, loss of colour depth and everything is smaller and takes longer to focus then other eye,.
 dont take them,."
"Taken for excruciating disc related shooting pains through my hips and down both legs.
 Was fine for the first 2 days, didn't feel much change in the pain but started feeling nauseous all the time which makes it hard to take because I need to take them with food.
 Havent had any for 2 days and still feel sick all the time, I'm supposed to take them for 3 weeks but I think I'll just go back to the dr and ask for the cortisone injection."
"Severe stomach cramps and diarea.
 Headache and drowsiness.
 Only took two pills.
 Will never take again due to the severity of the side effects.
 Cramps so bad that I felt like removing my intestines.
 Very scary pills.
 I'm done with pills.
 forever."
"After 3 doses of this med over 24 hour period, my pain was better; however, I experienced severe stomach cramping and diarrhea.
 IBS, which had been under control, seems to have returned with a vengeance!."
"I was on Voltaren to work as an anti-inflammatory for my infection.
 The drug was horrible.
 On second day of my medication, I experience an excruciating pain in my stomach, like gastric - but much worse.
 Along with that I also had a sharp pain on my shoulder and couldnt sit straight.
 I was admitted to hospital after 20 min of the pain and given MORPHINE when my doc knew that I was on Voltaren.
 It was acute gastritis.
 Worst adverse reaction I have ever experience.
 Doc told me to opt for non-NSAIDs such as aspirin next time."
"Severe stomach cramps and diarrhea.
 I will never use it again, worst drug ever."
"It helps relieve chronic pain but over time, causes intestinal pain and bleeding.
 I had symptoms similar to diverticulitis: blood in stool, pain.
 I would be cautious about paying attention to cramping, intestinal/stomach pain which can lead to very serious conditions."
"Took three pills in a day and a half and it put me in the er twice.
 Once for elevated bloodb pressure and dizziness.
 other for severe gastritis.
 Do not take this pill if you have stomach or blood pressure problems.
 Scary pill!."
"8 hours after taken voltaren, I had a severe allergic reaction.
 My skin felt like it was moving, and the itch on my head, genitals and lips was excruciating.
 My lips started to swell, then my tongue.
 Luckily I had an epipen in the medicine cupboard, and that saved me.
 I had taken this medication many times before for gout and a bit of arthritis.
 This was the first time I had the reaction.
 I am now severely allergic to NSAIDs."
"Made me very very tired, wanted to vomit but couldn't.
 Was to take one morning and night, couldn't take one in the morning or i was back in bed!
 My hands and hip pain remain."
"Stomach cramps, diarrhea, fatigue."
"I have vaginal bleeding and my vaginal skin burns a lot, my cycle was back (I'm menopausal ), breast pain Other symptoms I have: erithema, my skin is so dry I have little cuts on my hands, I 'm sweating a lot (usually I don't), pruritus ani etc
 I took it 3 times: the first for 3 days, then I stopped because it didn't make great improvements and I had diarrhea.
 My doctor told me the symptoms had to go away after taking few more Second time: I took other 3 pills in 3 days.
 little improvement with the pain.
 I had the first vaginal bleeding, a lot of pruritus and my skin was all red but I didn't know it was diclofenac.
 My doctor prescribed me a topical cream , did some vaginal test to exclude infections.
 I had my cycle The last one for 4 days.
 More problems and this time I had the idea to go on Internet and I discovered I had a lot of the side effects by taking it."
"stomach upset and notable dehydration.
 i would recommend plenty of food and water with this medicene."
"unbearable stomach cramps on the fifth day -- vomiting for about 7 hours straight until I went to the Emergency Room.
 They ended up cutting out my appendix -- I think it was inflamed due to the medicine."
"I have vaginal bleeding and cramping.
 .
 .
 it's taken me almost a week to realize this bleeding is due to the medication.
 The bleeding started almost immediately after taking the first dose.
 I initially thought I was having my period (even though it was not time).
 If anyone can give me info regarding how long this bleeding and cramping lasts, I would appreciate it."
"It only took three pills only one a day to realize that the side effects can be quite dangerous.
 On the first night my heart was thumping pretty hard all night and weird chest pains.
 On second night same thing plus pain in my kidney area as well as stomach.
 The third night was all of the night before plus nausea and skin irritation.
 The side effects quit after 4rth night.
 Volteren did nothing to help my arm.
 Even with a full stomach, this pill can be very hard to handle.
 Side effects can easily bring you closer to the grave."
"On day 8, starting wheezing at night.
 During the next 3 days the wheezing became a 24/7 side effect, with it being so bad at night, I couldn't sleep for more than 45 minutes.
 The wheezing literally woke me up, it was so loud.
 I also got a severe skin rash on the back of my neck, and on the back of one hand.
 Doc said I was the first person in his practice who ever had an allergic reaction to this drug, and."
"Lots of stomach gurgling after eating, which has been consistent even after adjusting to the medication, and initial doses gave diarrhea for a few days.
 I have switched to taking it with a snack before bedtime with good results.
 For me, it has been very effective pain relief for my chronic bone/joint pain from a broken elbow.
 So effective that I was able to substantially reduce the amount of narcotic pain reliever I was using once the Voltaren kicked in after about 2 days."
"Stomach cramps.
 When taken infrequently worked fine.
 No side effects When taking it twice daily side effects kicked in after one week."
"Took for 2 weeks.
 Towards the end, began getting tightness in my throat, tingling eyes and lips.
 These symptoms worsened over the following two weeks, especially the tightness in my throat until a severe case resulted in me colapsing from a heart attack and hospitalised for a week.
 Would never use it again or reccommend it."
"I was on celebrex till the SCARE of death took me off.
 Went on voltaren.
 Had wild dreams,gurgling stomach,tired, moody.
 4 months ago my heart stopped and they said I have high blood press.
 I never had it before.
 I find out on the net that voltaren over long times can actually cause hypertension.
 I now use tylenol extra for arthritis.
 Voltaren should in my opinion be given rectally to the mfg.
 It did alleviate the arthritis pain.
 It also made me dependent on tagamet after a few years.
 ThenI find out they two are not to be taken together.
 I was on voltaren for over 3 years."
"cramps ,diarreah dont take this stuff."
"dizziness first few days, mild nausea."
"I was taking 75mg only once every three or four days.
 At first it was miraculous, no pain.
 I felt fabulous, except I did notice mild headache.
 Then the side effects kicked in.
 Now , if I take only one pill, I have abdominal cramps, followed by diarrhea, lots of it!
 Also, LOTS of gas, gurgling, mild cramping all day.
 I tried one more today, immediately got a bad headache, and cramping, nausea, and heartburn.
 That does it.
 I'm going back to iubrofen!.
 I took this the first time in February 2008, and have taken it occasionally since.
 Basically it works great for my pain, but I can't live with the side effects."
"Extreme diarrhea, vomiting, extreme sweating, dizzyness, very weak, powerful chills but no fever, bloody discharge.
 Very bad reaction by my body."
"This drug MAY have caused edema of fingers and face after taking for 4 days.
 Also may have caused shortness of breath.
 Also some crabbiness and cramping (as in menstrual) and spotting.
 Timing off for a true period, so suspect Voltaren is the culprit.
 Took one 50 mg pill each day for 5 days.
 The first day it seemed to make all the pain of a muscle spasm in shoulder go away.
 It almost seemed like a miracle.
 The effects diminished each day (I have pain almost all the time) and now my face and fingers are swollen and I am short of breath, cramping and bloated.
 Interesting to see females posting similar troubles.
 I will NEVER take another one of these."
"dizziness,vertigo, altered taste, gas, little blisters in my mouth, itchy scalp.
 I was taking the topical gel.
 It worked quite well.
 I was really impressed.
 However, after 21/2 months, the side effects started.
 When I got the vertigo, I had to discontinue."
"Serious stomach discomfort.
 Diarreha, cramps, gas, bloating.
 It started about 10 day into my treatment.
 Around 4 hours after I took the pill (on a full stomach) the pain and diarreha would start.
 I stop treatment and went to an over-the-counter med.
 The kneejoin paint stopped but the side effects were awful."
"Had a scary experience that I am associating with Voltaren.
 Not completely convinced it was the RX but I have no other reason for the reaction.
 First dosage I was hit with extreme abdominal issues including diarrhea.
 Figured it was a lack of adequate food on board when I took the 1st dose so increased my meal before I took the 2nd dose.
 Problem solved!
 Was on the meds for 7 days when I experienced chest discomfort and upper abdominal pressure.
 With a medical background, I know that cardiac symptoms are mistaken for gastric reasons so I went to the ER.
 Long story short, I was diagnosed with severe gastric distress (GERD) and with a ""gastric cocktail"" and a high octane prilosec, I had some serious relief and sent home.
 Not convinced it was the issue, I went a day without the RX and then started again.
 I wasn't entirely 100% after taking the dose and now, I am fairly certain it was the Voltaren.
 I must say that my symptoms did improve within 3 days but the ER visit was."
"Always tired, and possible blood clots.
 I was on Voltaren for about 4 years and all of the sudden had a minor stroke and had blood clots that traveled to my eye.
 I had every test in the book done at the hospital, and they couldnt find anything.
 I was completley healthy!
 I am thinking it was from the voltaren.
 I have been off of the drug for 8 months now, and have never felt better.
 I started eating healthy and working out and that has help alot.
 I can now sleep all thru the night.
 I wont take this again.
 If I have the back pain, I will pop a tylonol instead."
"Slight stomach upset; blood in bowel movements, bloating.
 The Pain is 80% gone.
 Limbs and joints are so much more limber and inflamation has gone down amazingly.
 Started working within a few days."
With this one it just makes me a little drowsy!.
"Can cause a little stomach discomfort so take with food or milk.
 This has only happened to me when I've taken it on an empty stomach or accidentally took 2 pills in a 24 hour period.
 I have been taking voltaren for approx 8 years to help me battle gout.
 It is most effective when taken at first sign of gout symptoms.
 My doctor has me get a blood test every six months to make sure my liver and kidneys are ok."
"Makes me dizzy, silly, sleepy and feeling as if I am high.
 No weight gain or loss.
 Nothing else really.
 Works wonderful as a sleep aid.
 I still have the pain, I believe my Dr has misdiagnosed me."
"I took this medication for about 2 weeks.
 On day two I noticed a rash on the outside part of my left arm, then the it spread to to my back and front of my neck by day three.
 I also noticed some dizziness, bloated stomach, gas, and muscle weakness specially in my back.
 I had kidney pain on the right side to the point I could not bend forwad.
 I stoped taking this medication by the second week I was on it, however it is taking me a while to get better from the weakness, the rash is improving but my skin is stained with multiple brown dots.
 I would not recommend this medication."
"I was prescribed Voltaren-XR 100 MG for lower back pain.
 It worked wonders for my pain - I thought that I had discovered a wonder drug - then after 30 days I was at work and started passing massive amounts of blood without pain or warning.
 I thought I was bleeding to death!
 I went to the ER and was admitted and had a colonoscopy the next day.
 The Dr discover an ulcer in by lower bowel which he believes was caused by the Voltaren.
 The bleeding has now stopped and I am OK, but I will never take this drug or any drug in it's class again.
 Hindsight is 20-20."
"Psychosis, stomach upset, shaking.
 Didn't make the connection until recently.
 Got diagnosed bi-polar.
 DO NOT USE.
 This drug works by messing w/ your hormones and can be used as a mood stabilizer.
 I have a family history of instability or eccentricity.
 I have recurrent stomach problems and this drug upset my existing problems and was the catalyst for an all out break down.
 The doc.
 put me on seroquel after I was diagnosed bi-polar, SO much worse than being crazy.
 I've been off both medications and have returned to normal.
 This drug was casually prescribed as a pain reliever, it had serious side efeects and would not use it if there is ANY alternative.
 Take your ibuprofen."
"i notice there are a bunch of random ppl who gave the medicine a score of 5 without any explanation.
 I wouldn't be surprised if that was the pharmological company trying to promote their medicine.
 This drug is unsafe, leads to blood clots (which casues strokes and heart attacks), upset stomach, etc Asprin is safer and has less side effects."
"Haven't really experienced any side effects thankfully.
 This medicine seems to work very well.
 My throat still hurts while on it; however the pain is tolerable and I am able to function through the day until my virus works its course and I am finally over this horrible sore throat!."
"stiff neck, tightness in shoulders, muscle pain.
 not recommended."
